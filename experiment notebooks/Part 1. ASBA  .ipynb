      "I haven't been driving or traveling a lot this past year so when I went out on Fri. Sept 17, I sat in the driveway and pressed the OnStar button to get to an adviser. I asked to renew my OnStar for one year. It was $426.39 Wow... outrageous but I value the security that OnStar brings so OK... That evening I phoned OnStar from my home phone and got a great adviser. Why the enormous change from last year's renewal of only $202 ??? It seems that the first adviser, decided without asking me, to push me to a higher level. Bait and switch is a really low level deceptive sales method and unworthy of a fine company like OnStar. The second adviser was understanding and very helpful. I will be given a credit on my Mastercard for the $426.39 and was now charged $204.66. What an improvement. The second adviser gave me excellent customer service and restored my trust in OnStar. I would suggest that a supervisor give some training to the first adviser and discuss building customer loyalty through integrity. OnStar has a wonderful, well earned reputation. What a disservice to both the company and the customer for a representative to give OnStar a black eye by trying to improve their personal sales record.\n",

Before I was transferred to her, the other three staff members had no comprehension of what happened and did not know how to resolve the problem. That's why I asked to speak to a supervisor. I'm not sure if there was a training problem, but I've never had this issue with OnStar, where people are not able to understand what happened and are unable to help. This was so concerning and disappointing to me, as I always recommend OnStar to family, friends and colleagues. My experience on 12/10/21 was the first time I have ever cancelled a call because the associate on the phone was not able to locate me, so confused and no one was able to help her. I was late to work and on the way home was so lost! The associate could not pronounce many names of the streets and was truly struggling. I was lost for quite some time. I hope someone responds to me and takes this seriously. Thank you for your time.\n",

Little did I know it's all computerized you don't get to talk to a human except for 30 seconds of the initial call. Your computer connected me to I-95 at the worst possible connection at the state of Maryland & Washington DC instead of being a 12 hr drive it was 151/2 hrs. We were stuck in traffic for 2 1/2 hrs. I should have been given the connection to I- 95 in Fredericksburg VA. When you call you should able to speak to a human so you can tell them which routes you would like to drive. A computer is only as smart as the person who entered the data. I will never again use On Stars driving directions. I used Google Play Maps to drive home which took 11 1/2 hrs.\n",

Ginger has been keeping in contact like she said she would, the dealership where I bought the Buick are horrible. They wouldn’t return my phone calls.

After waiting a few minutes, I spoke with one person. That person then had to transfer me to another department to cancel my subscription. I waited even longer to finally speak to this person. This was frustrating. I just quickly wanted to cancel my subscription. When I purchased the car they pushed the deal to get OnStar free for so many months. That's fine. I didn't know what it all entailed. I know that my car has WiFi capabilities. I assumed that this option would be available because I had the service for a couple months. That wasn't the case. The representative informed me of what plan I had and WiFi was not a part of the plan. In my opinion, a plan that cost $39.99/month should come with ALL the features OnStar offers. That is an expensive add-on to a new car. The representative tried to get me a WiFi only plan. At that point I really was no longer interested. If you are charging people $39.99/month you need to provide better service if you want customers to keep it.\n",

After a half hour of trial cable jumps, and moving the fob around the car, we lucked up and it started and our trip continued. As we travelled, we called onstar and reported our strange incident. I asked what happened. Onstar said they did not show that we had any trouble, nor could they diagnose what happened. I went to dealer and they looked at me and said they had never heard of this, but onstar should have record of it. I said they did not. They said, well then just carry on, and hope I do not get stranded again. What good is onstar if you cannot reach them in distress and they know where you are, but cannot tell if you are having car trouble?\n",

      "In general, the app is very poorly organized. First off, the app claimed that my \"Vehicle Status\" was \"good to go, no issues\", despite the fact that my car would not start. When I tried to request roadside assistance with the app, the screen asked for mileage and VIN number. When I put in the mileage, a banner came up \"verify mileage\", yet there was not explanation how or what was wrong with what I entered, nor could I back out of this step. After multiple frustrating reentries, I finally entered the mileage without the comma for the thousands, which it accepted. When I tried to enter VIN #, nothing happened. After much frustration, I finally realized the VIN# was there but so faint, I could barely read it. After many tries, the app finally accepted my request. (this was around 6 PM.) We went to bed around 11, giving up on a response. The phone rang at approximately 2 AM waking me. The operator started by saying, \"Did you cancel the request for assistance?\" I said no and asked if they would replace the battery if they came for the jump start as the Service rep at DeVoe Cadillac told me they would, since the battery was still in warranty. She said no and I said why would I want a jump start now if I can't take to the dealership for repairs at this hour. She said, \"so you do want to cancel?\". I said yes and the conversation was over. Then OnStar sent me a message that I had a \"low battery\", apparently, the app could not get that info. this app is worse than useless, because it wastes time thinking you are getting somewhere.\n",

First agent hung up on me, not sure if it was because I said I wanted to cancel or was a technical issue, but not a great start. Next agent was trying to help me but then told me I would have to call back in because her computer was frozen. I pushed, she took a few minutes and then said that it was working now. She told me that it was fully canceled this time. She also said I should receive a refund. We'll see. In the meantime, I have contested the charge with my insurance company. She also informed me that I had the service I'd been paying for free for the next 10 years (came with the purchase of my vehicle).

She transferred me, but must have done it incorrectly because after about 10 minutes I was talking to the same rep. She never provided a good explanation why my calling Cadillac Roadside assistance didn’t result in me getting help. I asked to speak to her supervisor but she said she couldn’t do that for me.

I have had the OnStar Safe and Sound package activated on my 2005 Chevrolet Equinox for 17 years (yes, 17 years). Every year I have purchased the prepaid minutes for my Hands Free Calling, received my monthly Vehicle Diagnostic reports and considered myself fortunate to have OnStar as my co-pilot while driving. I just found out due to my calling OnStar (not by any type of notification via mail, email or text message sent by your company) that my phone will be deactivated this year and all other services will be deactivated by December 2022. I was completely blindsided! This is unacceptable! Now, in all fairness, I must mention that I asked for and immediately received a refund for my remaining prepaid minutes. Your representatives were EXTREMELY understanding and helpful! Unfortunately, due to the fact that my car does not have Bluetooth capabilities, I cannot utilize any of the other options available at this time. Yes, I did discuss this with both technical support and another customer service support representative who had additional information on the 2G deactivation schedule throughout 2022. I am also aware that the culprit(s) are the FCC, FTC and Verizon with their “Digital Disaster Dump” plans. What else is new? My point is your organization could have been more forthcoming with information and timely notifications on the impact many will have to deal with in the coming year. I am basically losing a service I have come to rely on and that’s depressing. Hopefully I will find some way of covering this loss.\n",

We were stuck on a dirt/gravel road and needed to be pulled out far enough to where we can get on part of the road that wasn’t as sandy and the car could have traction to get out and move towards the paved highway 78.

Experience has shown me to never use this ever again. We were on the brink of heat exhaustion and i’m glad the authorities and the towing service we called was able to get to where we were in time and not to mention the high level of human relations associated with it in which they went out of their way to get us water and electrolyte beverages to aid us.

It was explained to me about the guardian app to use instead but the services are NOT the same. I mainly had on star because if the truck was stolen you could shut it down and if the keys were accidently locked in it you could open the truck( I had to use that service before because my nephew used the truck to move to college 4 hrs away & he accidently locked the keys in it). It was nice to hear his panicked voice on the phone asking me what to do. I laughed & told him to stand outside of the truck & that I would call him right back. Naturally I called on star & it was immediately unlocked, it was great to hear his voice when I returned the call to him & he asked how I did that! ) I feel that GM should offer to have someone like me who has been loyal from day one to upgrade my vehicle with the new software to support 5G at no cost me and still offer the exact same services; or keep 3G/4G active for the older vehicles like mine. Then there is the fact that all of the minutes I purchased for the phone in the vehicle was no longer of service to me before the end of my contract! I feel that I should be reimbursed for those minutes. Even though my vehicle is an older vehicle it only has approximately 74,300+ miles on it. I purchased the truck to use on vacations to haul my motorcycles hence the low mileage. I have had to use on star to run a diagnostic a couple of times while on vacation because of warnings it gave me while traveling. I had to take it in to a dealership to have some problems taken care of at that time as well. Now I no longer have that service available to me.

      "My hands free minutes are expiring today. I called last week to purchase more minutes, even though I still have over 700 minutes. I was told On Star no longer offers hand free calling. I was talking to a lady (very nice), however I couldn't understand the info she was telling me because of her accent. What am I to do about making calls. I don't have a smart phone and know nothing about blue tooth. (I'm 73 years old). Emergency calls are all I usually make. No one even knows my phone number other than my wife. I'm very upset about losing all these minutes I have accumulated and the money I've spent. I have no idea of how I am to handle this new operation with On Star.. Also, I really would like to be able to speak to someone with an American accent. This might help me to understand. Thank you very much.\n",

      "I informed the operator what kind of car I had and I was told a Chevy expert was on his way. A guy with a car that didn’t even have door handles showed up. I also said I was in a parking garage. He didn’t want to enter because he did want to pay. He started out with a battery pack and I knew that wasn’t gonna be enough power for my vehicle. I had to tell him over and over to bring his car in to give me a jump. After he wasted 20 mins trying with his battery pack finally he entered the garage to jump my car. His battery in his very broken car didn’t have enough power to jump my car. He was just a waste of time. And to make matters worse he wanted me to pay him out of pocket. I don’t know if you guys allowed your workers to ask for money. But I think that is very rude and I won’t continue with my Onstar service because of my experience.\n",

So I was later for work waiting at dealer shop for 2 hours once I got there at the time the service man told me becuz then he say that that wheel and tire package won’t approve the claim u less I take 6 pictures of the vehicle . The entire service call from the waiting time , to professionalism with ppl answering the calls to the handleing of the wheel that needed a new tire . Worst experience of my life pertaining to a car. I honestly wanted to return the vehicle and neve buy another Cadillac . And this is the 6 th Cadillac I’ve purchased in my lifetime since the 1980s. It’s a sad day when the Cadillac name and onstar name are both worthless .\n",

      "Help derived within a half hour after I contacted you. I couldn't be any more pleased with the outcome. I was back on the road within an hour after my battery died. Anytime in the past, whether it was to get doors unlocked or to get directions, I have always been satisfied with your service. However, lately I have just learned I will no longer have your service. I don't think I should be lies just because my truck is free 2015, but time marches on. I'll be missing you for sure, now that I'm 81 years old I'm not quite as sure of myself as I have been in the past. Hopefully soon I'll be able to afford a new vehicle and get On Star. So much for OnStar, no I just want to express my displeasure since you don't have the telephone service any longer. It's probably not your fault but someone has to take the blame. Normally it would take me less than 5 days to use up the 300 minutes for $25. At any rate, dealing with general motors since 1961 has always been beneficial for me. GM is the best.

      "My Roadside Assistance was a very easy process. I had a tow truck within 45 minutes. However, I feel that i should not have had to use this service on a truck that I have had less than a year. At 9,000 miles, engine failure is a big problem for me (lifters collapsed). I've had 5 vehicles in my life, 4 of which have been GM products. All 4 have had major issues under 50,000 miles. This WILL BE MY LAST GM PRODUCT. $60,000 dollars for a truck i cannot drive is ridiculous. 60k for a Fortune 500 company isn't a drop in the hat, but for me it's a lot. I expect to have a really good product. A product I can depend on. Sadly, this is not that product. I'm not alone with this issue. Tens of thousands of people have had the same issue (lifter failure)(vehicles made September 2020 thru March 2021). I'm not real good at math but that's alot of 5.3L V8s. Now my vehicle is in the shop at my local dealer and they do not have courtesy transportation. So i get to bum rides to and from my destination, while paying insurance and payments on a truck that i cannot drive. I don't even know when I'll get it back or how many lifters they are replacing. Do better. Be better.\n",

I had other questions but it was obvious by her comments and tone of voice that she was annoyed at my assertions that I wanted to cancel and not accept any further service promotions. One of the questions I had was to ask for some sort of confirmation number or emailed receipt to verify that my cancellation had been completed. I had to call back and even though the second representative was much nicer, I had an extremely difficult time understanding his (her?) speech. During this process I was on hold for over an hour. Unacceptable! I called to cancel my account and for the life of me I can't understand how a business as prominent as Onstar isn't able to provide a confirmation number or emailed receipt of the request. If you conduct customer service this way how can customers retain faith that you'll be there if an emergency comes up? The experience of being treated this way sure contaminated my experience of buying a new Chevy. Instead of an advocate I'm now an adversary.\n",

Each time we agreed on the yearly price, I requested an invoice so I can pay the bill, but no invoice was ever sent. We shall see if I get the invoice I requested this time around. If it does come in, you can change my latest interaction to a 10, it stands at 7 until I in fact receive the invoice requested.

The agent finally assured Me On Star did not attempt a re-accuring payment of $299.00..

When I called to ask why the payment was $25, I was told that I must have been on a promotion that had ended and I was pretty much ignored when I told them it wasn't a promotion. My bill was dropped back to $20, but I wasn't offered a credit for the $5 that I was overcharged. The rep. mentioned 3 times that it might it have been a promotional price. I thought records were kept of the transactions made on my account. I still would like to know why my bill went up by $5. I get endless emails wanting me to buy something else, why not just one email to inform me that my service would cost more? I believe it was an attempt to make more money, thinking I wouldn't notice since I'm on auto-pay.\n",

I use to be really excited and happy with on star; It was a service that only Chevy offered and I enjoyed speaking to a live person, however with the most recent inconveniences and glitches I've experienced I debate very often canceling my services. The only good thing I can say so far is about the rate I've been giving. After fighting with the price increasing ever 6months to a year. I've found a rate I can afford.

I did usually keep phone minutes on it but was not aware that the minutes would expire if not used by a certain date. Yesterday, 12/27/2021 I was parked in the parking lot at Parkland Hospital in Bonne Terre, Mo. because my 91 year old mother was in the ER. I decided I'd use my Onstar phone to call a family member because my cell phone was getting low. I was told by the foreign lady that was very hard to understand that my minutes had expired on the 24th. I asked why I had not been notified of that and she said it was because they didn't have my e-mail address. I was furious that I had paid for minutes all this time and had not used them but was not notified that they would expire if I didn't use them by a certain date. I will never purchase on-star again. I just called to cancel my service and the girl I spoke with was very nice and apologized that I was treated that way. She said I should have been offered some minutes to make the call since it was an emergency situation. I've wasted a lot of money in 3 and 1/2 years with Onstar that wasn't used. I will never purchase it again and I've learned my lesson that it's better just to use my cell phone. About her saying you didn't have our e-mail address, I just saw it is filled in by you on this e-mail that you just sent me! Hmmmmm, that's a miracle a guess!\n",

Alvis continues to work hard to to make sure that I am a satisfied Cadillac customer The only upset I had was the policy, and for that I will contact GM directly.

      "I had been receiving communications that my 2014 Traverse would no longer be supported by Onstar and that I could continue to pay and use it through an app on my phone. The reason I kept Onstar on my car was that I felt like it was a peace of mind in my CAR, not reliant on if I had my phone in the car with me. I did start to look at the app and the reviews were not positive so I decided it was a waste of money to continue to pay for a service I rarely used and only wanted it as a safety precaution when I am driving (again, not on my phone) and I decided to cancel my subscription. When I called to cancel, I explained what I needed and was transferred to someone that did not have a clear connection and then transferred to another man who had a very thick accent that was hard to understand. I explained that I wanted to cancel and the reason why. Of course (as I suspected would occur as is typical for sales people), he proceeded to try to convince me to keep the service. I said I understood that was what he was supposed to do, but that I did not want to use an app on my phone for something that should be (and has up to this point) utilized in my car. Yet again, he proceeded to persuade me to keep the service and use it through the app. I once again stated that I had researched the app and the reviews were such that for me, it was not something I wanted to continue to pay for and he HUNG UP ON ME!!!!! TRULY RUDE!!!! This communication made me feel 100% that I had made the right choice. If this is the type of customer service I had to expect, I was happy to cancel. In my opinion, if technology has changed to make your service not available in the cars it was purchased to benefit, your company should enhance YOUR technology and make it accessible for the people who have accounts. Having a poorly functioning app is not a solution as a safety and security benefit while DRIVING YOUR CAR!!!!\n",

If I was not a good friend of the owner of the dealership I would not have been so patient. Why it took 3 months to reach an executive level person to solve the problem , I have no idea. Finally, just this week a lady named Glenda contacted me; and said the problem was corrected. She was super helpful and very apologetic. It finally works after about 30 hours of my personal time. I have purchased or sent personal friends to this dealership to purchase a vehicle over 15 times in the last 10-12 years, so it is a good thing the Taylor's are good personal friends. The Taylor Cadillac Dealership was at no way responsible for this 3 month nightmare, they were as frustrated as I was. There has to be a way to reach the executive level easier than waiting months.

No human wants to wait almost a half hour to cancel their data package. Something that took 3 min to do. Your process creates bad service from long hold times inflected by your company processes. Automation is key. Someone should be able to cancel data and add data on their app easily. I know to never get data again if needed through you because the labor market can’t support your ridiculous practices. Maybe you have an older leadership team who still thinks a person needs to physically talk to someone to enhance service. Nope. People want convenience and swift processes.

      "Cadillac ordered for a flatbed-tow. The tow driver called me and asked what was wrong with my car. I told him. He said \"You really dont need a flatbed-tow, do you?\" I said \" I need exactly what Cadillac requested. The tower (Allison Towing) arrived with a wheel-lift tow truck. I said I want my vehicle towed how Cadillac requested the tow. He said that Allstate received the tow order and my car is a front wheel drive so it doesn't matter about the type of tow that will pickup my car. I advised that my vehicle is going for repairs under Cadillac's warranty and I want it towed the way that Cadillac requested. He said it will take a few hours before a flat bed tow can get my car, and asked if that was o.k. or do I want him to tow it. I said \"No: I want my car towed how Cadillac requested and I will wait for the correct tow to arrive.\" I called Cadillac. Cadillac confirmed that a flatbed tow was requested. I told Cadillac representative that the tower did not arrive with a flattbed. Cadillac asked if I wanted to cancel the tow and get another tower. I agreed. Cadillac called me back, confirmed that the 2nd tow company would have a flatbed to pick up my vehicle. The 2nd company (Watson Towing Transportation) arrived with a two-wheel bed, just as the 1st towing company had. Simultaneously Allison Towing returned. Both at my home at the same time. As I spoke to the 2nd driver a d was calling Cadillac on my phone, the driver with Allison Towing said he didnt have time for my concerns, because he had been here (at my home) 4 times (which was a lie). He got in his truck and left, as did the 2nd tower. My vehicle is still not towed. I've NEVER had such a disservice like this before. I'm totally unhappy and frustrated with this entire ordeal. I am paying to have my vehicle towed to Hendricks Cadillac in Virginia Beach, eventhough my vehicle is Under Warranty. This is my first Cadillac Experience and has been completely a nightmare!\n",

      "My OnStar Guardian subscription was cancelled and I still don’t know why. I called in the phone and the call disconnected and I couldn’t get back in touch with them. I then tried chatting through online at my computer and they told me that I had to be in my vehicle to resubscribe to the guardian subscription. So I went to my vehicle, pressed the blue button and spoke to an agent who disconnected my call after I was trying to still get my subscription reactivated. It was like, nobody at OnStar wanted to work and do there jobs yesterday to reactivate my subscription. I even had trouble trying to do it in my own through the guardian app, getting a consistent error, please contact an agent. I am not happy at all, my vehicles are 2005 and 2014 and are getting sunsetted at the end of the year and I’m still without guardian service.\n",

The first lady I talked to was supposed to delete the old card and add the new card. Well, a week later I receive an email that my OnStar has lapsed and was out of force. The payment is made on the 22nd of the month and this was the 9th of the month. I checked and sure enough, both of my cars had been canceled. So, I called again to see what the story was. It seems the first lady decided to cancel my coverage and refund my money via check. And she did not delete the old card. I don't really care if I have OnStar or not. I have driven for 55 years without it most of the time and got by fine. I explained to the lady that if they want to cancel me that would be fine. I just wanted to know why. No real answer to that but she did delete the old card and did reinstate both cars and made me a fair deal which was an acceptable recovery.\n",

BIG mistake in changing your offers to vehicles under 2015. 😤 The wonderful, sweet young lady who had to listen to our frustrations, explained OnStars reasons, very patiently. I apologized to her for my being so upset. Whoever reads this, go & tell those bigwigs, with their degrees that make these changes, “Don’t think that we seniors don’t feel disrespected when they come up with new ideas.😡 We also DO, still have a huge influence on our younger loved ones.

The graciously gave me back 600, but informed me that the whole hands-free capability was going to be cancelled in mid-February, 2022. This is crap. My car (2006 Cad. XLR) doesn't have bluetooth capability, so the hands-free capability is very (!) important to me. 2) They informed me that my program was not available anymore. Since navigation isn't worth a damn on my \"olde\" car, the primary reasons I subscribed to OnStar at all was the hands-free and the stolen vehicle capability. At first, we were told that the stolen vehicle feature wasn't available any more, and that it had been cancelled months before! When I subscribed to the service, OnStar made the commitment to provide the services for the entire year. I received no refund for the cancelled services. I am disgusted with the lack of customer advocacy within OnStar. 3) The OnStar agent told me that someone from OnStar would be contacting me about this; so for, \"No Joy!\"\n",

      "The most recent call was very helpful and informative. However, the first time I called, I had to call 4 times because no one knew which department I should have been transferred to. Then I spoke with, Blanca, a Spanish speaking representative who was very unhelpful and didn't even offer to transfer me to billing. She sounded annoyed although we only spoke for no more than 15 seconds. All she offered as a resolution was, \"I don't know.\" I had to end the call myself and call again (a 4th time) as opposed to transferring my call after having called On* 3 times prior to our conversation. On* made it sound as if I had an extremely complex situation. The reason why I needed to speak to someone was because I had to order a new debit card through my bank and my payment was due on the 2nd of the month. My debit card arrived a week later, so I needed to know how the payment for the month would be taken care of. Charles in billing had finally made it possible for me to take care of the matter....after 4 calls! The second call was a failure as well. I kept getting transferred to other representatives without even being informed ahead of time. The entire experience was bizarre.\n",

      "After the lifters went out on our 2021 Tahoe for a second time and left us stranded 12 hrs away from home in a town without a GM dealership or tow company, Chevy Roadside Assistance towed our car to the wrong dealership, which was over an hour away from the dealership we turned in. After Chevy Roadside’s error, we had to spend hours on the phone trying to get to the right “team” to get Chevy to approve a transfer from a dealership to a dealership. We waited a day without contact, no one could give us straight answers on when this would happen or whether they would even cover it even though it was their mistake. It was going to take them 2 days to get us our vehicle to just be transferred to the right dealership. We were out of a hotel, and there was not a car rental place in the town we stayed in. We had to pay more to stay in town, and we made the decision to pay out of pocket to get the car towed immediately so that the dealership it was supposed to go to could get started on the repair. Once the car was fixed, we called roadside again for the reunite and spent hours on the phone just to be told that we would have to wait for that decision to be approved. It was 3 hours later when we got a call that our reunite was denied because it was less than 100 miles. It was 96 miles away. No one told us that rule when we called initially; we waited another half day to find this out. We paid out of pocket for our car to be towed back to us. This car is under full warranty.\n",

      "Our 2021 Escalade ESV has required service ~ a dozen times in the 14 months we have owned it. This is the second time in less than 4 months where the vehicle has been inoperable. My wife, son and I were stranded on the side of a road, in the dark for hours. We had 3 other children at home alone that we could not get to. It took multiple attempts for over an hour to get a customer service agent to confirm that they were able to secure a tow truck. However the service they secured was located in Philadelphia, at least an hour away. Keeping in mind that there are plenty of alternatives near our location. We were given a wait time for the tow service - after they were more than 30 mins late, we called the towing company directly. The towing company had not dispatched anyone at this point, and said they did not intend to do so for hours. They said they would need to take care of \"all towing jobs in the city of Philadelphia first\". At this point we took matters into our own hands. Reached out to a local towing service who had the car on the truck and ready to go in only 30 minutes. We should have done this from the start. It is clear that Cadillac roadside assistance places more value on the bottom line than in the safety and satisfaction of your customers. This is unacceptable to choose a low cost provider (with a very low customer service rating) for new vehicle that we just spent well over $100,000. We have the disposable income to purchase any vehicle, my time (and more importantly my family's safety) is worth far more than the ~$100 Cadillac would have saved in providing a towing service that is consistent with the level of vehicle we are driving. Our experiences with Cadilac over the last 14 months have been the worst of any car owning experience (our family has owned just about every luxury brand at one point or another) - last night however solidified why we will never purchase another Cadilac again, and we will make sure that everyone we know is aware of Cadilac's failure in every way to provide an operable vehicle and/or meet basic customer service standards. A problem for any car - but most certainly for a brand that considers themselves a luxury car manufacture.\n",

Earlier versions of the myChevrolet mobile did not force the user to enter their login credentials every time they wanted to use the app - please consider caching or saving these so that the user does not need to continually re-enter their password. 2. The app frequently gets \"stuck\" on the splash screen after entering user credentials, forcing the user to completely close (and force quit) the app, then (again) re-enter their credentials. 3. It is handy to be able to send Lock / Unlock commands to the vehicle, but it seems silly that there is no means of simply confirming the present status of the door locks. 4. In the Energy \"tab\" the Update Location & Battery command does not work (it updates the battery level, but then gets stuck indefinitely \"Fetching vehicle location...\"), and it seems that this should be an unnecessary step, given that the app has already just updated the battery level in the Home tab, and (usually) doesn't have any problem determining the current location of the vehicle using the More tab > Vehicle Locate function. 5.

      "I was frustrated with directions this weekend, but I don't think it was entirely On-Star's fault. I was in Woodbridge, NJ. My destination was on Rt. 9 North, and several times I had to travel past my original destination. Rt. 9 is divided by a concrete divider. Therefore, I had to go past my hotel and loop back south to get to it if I had traveled further north. Here is where the problem came in. Woodbridge is a large group of tiny little streets, by-ways and unexpected exits and loops. On-Star would say turn \"right in .2 miles\". While I am driving I cannot be staring at the countdown of mileage. The voice would not state a road name, just \"turn right\". Not turn at the third possible turns which are next to each other, not the street name (except occasionally), or a different name than on signs. I spent a LOT of time making U-turns on very cramped, tiny streets, with cars parked on either side, where you had to pull off to let another car pass (often in someone's driveway). I shook a lot while driving. If only there was somewhere to say specifically where they want you to turn. Or not say, turn right then immediately left, where left is across 5 lanes of traffic, so of course, more U-turns. Thank you for letting me vent. I did find my way home by myself, because of one U-turn I had used multiple times. Thank you for letting me vent.\n",

My complaint driving a zero rating for OnStar concerns customer service since I never used OnStar. I contacted OnStar when I started getting charged for OnStar service. When I purchased my truck new I was offered a free trial which I was not interested in but there was a very hard sell by the OnStar representative to give it a try. I was told that they would not begin regular, charge service at the end of the trial without my approval. When I began being charged for OnStar and I talked to the OnStar representative about it several things happened that were VERY unpleasant. First, the person I talked to pushed hard, very, very hard, to scare me into keeping the subscription. When I directly told him to knock off the hard sell and that I just wanted to cancel the subscription he says yeah, yeah yeah (blather, blather....), and then continued to try other avenues to scare me into continuing the subscription. This continued for a long time and only when I told him that I am a ex-GM employee and that his behavior made me embarrassed to have the GM association (are they treating all customers this way?) did he proceed to finish the business I contacted OnStar for. Then we started talking about why the subscription charges started without my approval. He told me that OnStar had sent me a diagnostic report and that in the report there was something talking about beginning the subscription. WHAT? BURYING such a topic in a DIAGNOSTIC REPORT? Highly questionable thing to do. This behavior by OnStar is not the ethical GM behavior I experienced as a GM employee.

The first one came and left without seeing us and claimed that the manager of the facility where were parked denied permission for them to change our tire. When we spoke to the manager of the facility, he said that no one had spoken to him. The second road rescue service dropped our job because he got a higher priority call he had to take care of. However, no one informed us of this so we were left waiting until we called that service provider. The next roadside assistance agent said all the in network providers were busy for the next 15 hours! Finally, the agent said she would go out of network and found someone who came in 30 minutes and changed the tire in 10 minutes. We suggest that you add \"4Way Roadside Service\" to your in network providers. In all, we waited 4 hours to get this process done.\n",

      "My vehicle became disabled due to a transmission issue. GM roadside assistance coordinated a tow truck. While waiting some time for the tow, I noticed that the status changed to cancelled. I used the chat feature in the app to confirm I still needed a tow and to request another. A second provider was assigned, I waited only to have the same cancelation happen again. I again contacted A rep through the app. The rep would not respond to my questions and cancelled the chat so I called OnStar. They booked a 3rd tow provider and I waited again. The contact number for the provided was a non working number and after waiting 1 1/2 hrs, the provider cancelled. Free taking with OnStar for a 4th time, they were unable to secure a provider. I ended up booking a local tow service myself. Temperatures in Houston were 100+ degrees. This failure of service is completely unacceptable.\n",

      "Purchasing our brand new vehicle was quick & painless. We had a specific car in mind with a specific package & trim. We had shopped around at a few dealerships on the Island and quickly realized Chevrolet of Smithtown was the most friendly & accommodating. Kitty Dubester greeted us when we walked into the dealership. Kitty was happy, wonderful, cheerful, very knowledgeable and helpful from start to finish. She was so helpful and she did everything to make it happen for us and give us the deal we wanted. One of the things we liked the most about this dealership is that in no way they are high pressure. We felt very relaxed while we were negotiating and truly felt that everyone wanted to make our first Chevrolet car buying experience pleasant. Once the deal was made, we came next day to pick up our car. Kitty kept in contact with us and made sure we were up to speed on everything. When we came in to sign the paperwork and pick up our car, we sat with Joe in the finance department. He also wasn't high pressure and extremely friendly. He explained everything and I was signing thoroughly. I had an overall pleasant experience with my paperwork... not to mention the fact that he had me in and out of the office in less than 30 min...no exaggeration! Once the car was signed over Kitty took us outside and explained everything inside the vehicle from top to bottom. She was patient and answered all of our questions. All and all we had a pleasant experience purchasing our Chevrolet Tahoe 2022 car from Chevrolet of Smithtown! Each employee we encountered was friendly and low pressure! We would definitely recommend seeing Kitty Dubester for your car buying needs. A huge thanks to everyone!!\n",

However, he did have an appointment where it was indicated he would be waiting. He waited two hours for just the oil change, so that seemed like an excessive amount of time for just an oil change if appointments are scheduled appropriately. Nevertheless, I believe this is the only Maus location where he can receive the \"Maus Care\" oil change/tire rotation (at no charge), so we'll be back as long as he still owns this vehicle.

And I don’t feel I want to use an app on my cell that is being offered now to use for $15 a month fee starting in 2023 either. I liked looking at my navigation screen in the SUV to see which turns were coming up, and how much longer I had to get to my destination.

Then, I called roadside and they found a close person to fix tire and I got that text.

He was so nice and friendly! Yesterday, when I got my flat tire it was actually my birthday. Doug told me his birthday was on Monday, August 1. He talked to my husband on the phone to locate a tool he needed then worked on my tire. My spare tire was regular size, but that didn’t stop Doug-he got some wood he had in his truck and jacked up my tire higher so he could replace the new one.

I’m 77 yrs old and It appeared that my ability to ask/text the Rep the questions needed to resolve my concerns and update my service was just to hard using the chat/text method of communication with ONSTAR. I will need to contact ONSTAR again to actually make any needed changes in my service. This in no way suggests the Rep didn’t do a good job. She was patient (our communication lasted 3 hrs). There was a lag in time between my questions and her response, so it confused me. I assume that the Reps are probably responding to a number of customers at the same time. If my assumption is right… she really did do an incredible job and was so patient. Verbalization with a Rep via phone is better for me. Chatting via text is just too cumbersome for me.\n",

      "I called once back in June to see about canceling any OnStar trials or memberships because I didn't want to be charged for them. The person I spoke to at the time told me that I had another couple months of my trial period and nothing would get charged to me before receiving plenty of notice that I was going to be charged. He said I would get email notifications letting me know that my free trial/s was/were ending and that I could then cancel them at that time. So I let him talk me into it and decided to wait til I got notification that my trial/s was/were coming to an end. That email never came. I happened to notice a charge in excess of $31+ on my bank activity for OnStar services and immediately called. The woman I spoke to was pretty unprofessional. I explained to her that I did not receive any notice that I was about to be charged and that I wanted to cancel any and all services and wanted to see about having a refund issued. She not only insinuated that I was being dishonest about calling a couple months before to cancel, she also continuously interrupted me as I was trying to speak and explain. It was very rude and I didn't appreciate it. She also said I should have known the trial was about to end, but is true, I SHOULD have known, but I didn't. I didn't get that email. And what irritated me about this situation is the ONLY reason I didn't cancel back in June was because the guy explicitly told me that I would get notification before being charged, which is exactly what DIDN'T happen. Then, I noticed that I did receive a refund, but it wasn't for the full amount. I was shorted a little over a dollar. A dollar and some change isn't a big deal, but when I'm already upset with OnStar for charging me and then having to speak to a rude woman who kept interrupting me, it made feel like a much bigger deal. The only reason I'm giving a 1 instead of a 0 is because at least I got MOST of my refund. But overall, I was very disappointed with my experience with OnStar customer service and how this all went down. Keep the damn dollar. The likelihood of me getting OnStar in the future just took a big hit because of this incident.\n",

Your criminal behavior in conjunction with your extremely high prices have sealed your fate in my mind. I will be cancelling everything once the trial period is over. I do not patronize dishonest companies. My advice to everyone who will listen is NEVER give them a credit card, it isn't worth it. You damn well better be sending me the cancel email as I was told prior to ever adding any additional charges to my card. I specifically asked if I could cancel using the email or if it was a more lengthy process and was told yes I can cancel with the email. Was this all another lie to get my credit information?

My resolution took several calls with several hours' cumulative hold time. The OnStar advisors I spoke with were adverse to action as they either couldn't find this functionality or did not realize that this was separate from the remote commands on more traditional vehicles. My attempts to escalate to a supervisor yielded more hours on hold and one promised callback that I never received. Upon finally reaching a supervisor, she confirmed with the connectivity team that this functionality exists and I should never have lost it when my trial expired. The app's remote commands were restored shortly after, although I received a call a few days later from someone on the technical team stating that they were unable to provide the functionality for 5 years. I called back and an advisor confirmed that I would have the functionality for 10 years. Due to this experience, OnStar has guaranteed that I will never subscribe to their services and am highly unlikely to purchase another GM vehicle in the future.

      "As a retired Buick/GMC salesperson, I know how important these surveys are, and how they might be tied to individual employee performance reviews. Therefore, I start at a 10. In my experience yesterday, I chose to use the myGMC app to initiate my service for a jumpstart. After completing all required fields, a message pops up that the app can’t complete my request and has a number to tap to call. Rating down to a 9. When connected to a rep, I’m asked to give the last 8 of my vin. I’m guilty of assuming since I started the request via the app, my info would be available on their end. Of course, I was able to provide the vin, using my magnifier feature on my iPhone to read the finite print on my registration. Rating Down to an 8. My experience after the jumpstart request was submitted didn’t meet my expectations either. But I don’t hold GM Roadside completely accountable for the driver assigned to this task.\n",

      "The Onstar representative was completely professional and appeared genuinley concerned with my situation, Ladarrious was great at what he could do to assist me... He even asked if I felt safe where I was at. Onstar needs more advisors like Ladarrious with his willingness to listen and professionalism, along with the want to assist! As for the GM Roadside, the representative did not seem to care or want to assist with the situation, I ended up calling my wife to come down in her vehicle to use her jack. All I needed was a jack, I had a spare tire. 7+ hours is unecceptable for anyone to have to wait! On the roadside end of it there needs to be a greater improvement in all areas... I have had Onstar with every GM vehicle I have owned and will continue to keep it, however GM may want to look into better ways to handle the Roadside assistance representatives and their associates, along with their subccontractors....\n",

I went to make a phone call with some of the 45 monthly minutes-I've used less than 60 in five years, and was told I had no minutes and needed to pay my bill-it was already paid. now I'm told that to make a call if I forget my phone, I have to wait for the On Star advisor to relay the call as your carrier went BK. I have to buy the most expensive package just for navigation every year for a crappy system, only because I wont try to punch addresses into my phone for Google directions which are much more reliable, because it's not safe to do that. Google Play is much more efficient and accurate for $0. My wife just purchased her Traverse last year, after three new vehicles in 5-6 years, and bought a Hyundai Pallisade, I will be buying a new Truck next year, but it wont be Chevy. When you are charging a premium price for a substandard product like On Star, it makes the whole product line stink!\n",

It was not a peaceful sight to see the engine light come on but I knew I had an ace in the hole to call Onstar and have the reps to give me some idea of what was going on with my vehicle. I love that I have this feature for my vehicle. The rep assured me that although it was serious and could be check out within 7 days, I could still make it to work. I took that info of the diagnostics from OnStar, prayed and traveled cautiously to my shift that night. I am counted on to be there at my employer and I work out of town. This is a critical time to be working. I enjoy my job in manufacturing, and everyone who is scheduled to work is so needed. This information about my vehicle's engine light notification helped me to be informed and have a good night knowing my vehicle could still get me there to my job.

      "I needed a jump, and csr was helpful and responsive as always. The rep l, Jerica, did show some concern I needed a jump start the day after I needed a tow, but I explained both issues are related to the same mechanical problems I am working on, and she helped. The jump start tech, Xavier, was very helpful and professional, and even shared some advice on my mechanical issues. I also have some general feedback for On Star. I am disappointed the calling / telephone feature is being discontinued. It offered peace of mind knowing I could reach a friend if I left my cell phone at home. Also, I overall really like On Star. The customer service is incredible, navigation is useful, roadside assistance is unparalleled except by the likes of AAA, and the emergency services are interesting. However the $30/mo price point, although comparable with AAA, is prohibitively expensive for someone like me who has Roadside Assistance al coverage available as a part of a bundle with Progressive Auto Insurance and AT&T. I like that the My Chevrolet App is a separate product, offered at $15/mo for my 2011 Chevrolet Cruze. It’s features are unique to My Chevrolet, and not offered by my third party Roadside Assist including vehicle local tete, Key Fob app, and vehicle diagnostics.

It gets very fraustrated when I need to speak to the person and cant get connected.

      "I do not have a spare due to having run flat tires. They do not not help when u have a punctured tire that holds no pressure. The phone person knew I had run flat and no spare and entered that information in her computer or device she was collecting the information in. The road assistance texted info on the person coming and the place he was coming from. The tire person Kham texted that he was coming and expected eta and kept in contact with me however he gets there and wants the spare. I explained I had no spare due to it not being provided with run flat tires. He wanted to look for it and I told he could unload my car and look but I have no spare. He said he couldn’t help me without a tire. He found a 24 hr tire service and gave me the number to call. This young man was very polite, kind and helpful. So he went on to do another run. I called the tire service, they had a tire that would work and brought it out and changed it for me. The first young man Kham did text me later to make sure I was taken care of. My complaint is not with the service but with these ridiculous run flat tires. All cars need a spare provided with them no matter what is on the ground. I hope y’all consider including spares in new vehicles in the future. This was a terrible way for me to find all this out about these tires and now I am purchasing a full sized spare! Overall the experience with the assistance service was awesome. I got help quickly and the communication was great how they kept me in the loop of what was going on to get to me. Only problem was Kham not knowing I didn’t have a spare. I was very frustrated with the tire going flat immediately and being unable to do anything. Run flat tires are not for me.\n",

I had received a notice from Buick about renewing my account which quoted a higher cost than I had expected, but I did not take the time to look up the amount I paid last year for renewal. The young man was puzzled when I told him the cost of a one year renewal, and he pointed out was only for the key fob, and asked where I got the information from. He then proceeded to look up the amount I paid last year for what was called the Protection Plan - it was $149.90 rather than the $156.65 from Buick for only the remote access plan! He then looked a little further and said he could offer me the Protection Plan which is what I wanted for $135.14!

An ONSTAR Rep. came on the line and informed me that some program I signed up for about a year ago had expired and the \"Hands Free Calling\" feature would no longer be available. I expressed my displeasure that a program which I had come to depend on would so suddenly end with no warning, that was when the Rep emphatically informed me that ONSTAR had notified me! Since then, I have been trying to decide if there is any reason that I should continue with the ONSTAR program at all! The representative was not rude but was but was a bit too sure of the fact that I had been informed that the program was ending, a matter which I still have absolutely no recollection of. For me, the one redeeming feature of the ONSTAR program was the \"Hands Free Calling\". Other than that, I find the program to be significantly overprice for the convenience provided. I still am seriously considering dropping the program altogether. At this time, I am giving myself the opportunity to cool down a bit (not to mention the hope that I am not alone, and the voices of other customers may convince you to continue the program).\n",

Later I was able to speak with Customer Service Representative Latasha (out of AL) who was extremely professional and caring.

My BRAND NEW 2022 Chevy Blazer only 3wks old with 2600 miles has a transmission that failed and is shot.Fortunately we were able to get off the road as it occurred. Pretty unbelievable that this happened!! I have leased GM vehicles for decades. I purchased this (leased) to have reliable vehicle as a single parent traveling with two young kids to Myrtle Beach for my son’s tournament. The evening this occurred it took 3.5hrs to get “rescued” by GM securing the tow truck and tow truck drivers daughter to drive myself and my two children to a hotel 5 miles away (forever grateful to Brigette). It took another 3+hrs the next morning to secure my own transportation to obtain a rental car from the nearest airport which was 48miles away. This ride cost $175 along with $395 for a one way rental to drive 10.5hrs home after that (and of course hotel cost). Only to find out last evening 8/11 that I can not submit these fees until my car is fixed - estimated to be WEEKS from now and no guarantee of being covered in full. My brand new car is nonfunctional and all of this money will not be reimbursed until my car is hopefully fixed in a few weeks. It also is unfortunate and frustrating to make my first payment on a car I do not have!! MY dealership Victor Chevrolet (specifically Carmen Indiano) has been incredible to work with.

When I got home online I found Onstar Premium Plan to be a Total of 49.99 that included Data, I called and immediately had the correct plan implemented so that I would be paying a 34.99 Onstar bill and a 15.05 AT&T Data Plan per month. My recommendation is that all your reps learn what the various current On Star plans available are that way they can offer these better plans when setting up a new car purchase. In my case what was tried to sell me on at the car dealership setting up the vehicle was 64.99 verses what actually is the best plan OnStar carries the Premium which is 49.99 which includes Data.\n",

Oh, they dude on the phone today was a real snot, he was fine until I told him to cancel the service, then he got condescending and snotty.\n",

      "I called at 9:40. I usually don’t write bad reviews but this time I am. A company should not bid on a job if they can not show up with a reasonable time frame. Car didn’t get picked up until after 2pm. I was trying to get it to the shop early before they closed so they could find whst was wrong with it now I have to wait til Monday. Was going to rent a car couldn’t make it to that because they closed at 1pm. This is the second time I’ve tried to use this service and both were bad experience. The first time the lady was so hard to deal with I just gave up and called another wrecker that showed up in a few minutes and took care of the problem. I’m glad I wasn’t standing on the side off the road.\n",

      "I spoke with Chevrolet Customer Assistance and was pleased with her assistance but the roadside was a joke. The lady was like a robot showed no compassion at all. Stayed on phone for over 3 hours dealing with this. Was told that tow truck would arrive in 40-45 minutes it arrived within 5 minutes. At this time when he arrived I was on hold again and spoke with Ramone who also was a joke and rude. Tells me that it is not his job to look for hotels around me and to call them. Stated that was my job. Again I was on phone for over 3 hours. Not to mention stranded over 5 hours away from my home with 2 young kids in an unfamiliar location. The tow truck driver heard the entire conversation with Ramone and was appalled at the way he was speaking to me. I never was given a driver to a location. The tow truck driver offered to carry me and my kids to the dealership with my car while I waited for my parents to come get me. So I sat in that lot till 3:40 AM with my two kids scared. Also to mention the tow driver was given this information. That the car was left there by a single individual and it would be unlocked and keys inside. He did not know that when he arrived I was in the car along with my children. Also he told them he would be at my location in 5 minutes. This is the text I received from Roadside Assistance At 10:04 PM Due to labor shortages in your area, finding a rescuer is taking longer than normal. Rest assured we will provide details shortly At 10:25 PM MCROBERTS AUTO TOWING AND RECOVERY provided the quickest ETA, arriving between 10:55 PM and 11:05 PM. If you need to contact them, their number is 276-620-5215 At 11:05 PM MCROBERTS AUTO TOWING AND RECOVERY should be on site or arriving soon. In case you need it, their number is 276-620-5215 Again he arrived way before this!! Again an absolute JOKE!!\n",

I did what he said I had my car off for 2 minutes when did you go turn it back on and my battery was dead so I was stranded so I called back and it took that person an hour to come out and I couldn't have my car towed where I wanted and the person I spoke with towed my car to a dealership on bandera and wurzbach in San Antonio Texas but yet set an appointment for my car to be serviced at a dealership in boerne Texas which is like 23 miles away from where they had my car towed so I had to get the dealership to start my car and drive it to Firestone just so they can replace my battery. And I ended up wasting an entire afternoon and most of my evening which could have been avoided had the first person tested my battery to see if it was actually good or not.\n",

If they towed the car to the dealer it would have sat there for 2 days due to the July 4th holiday. What was I suppose to do then without a car? I ended up figuring out how to fix the vehicle. Cadillac needs to have techs in hand to help in these situations rathe than just say wan tow your car to the nearest dealership. Like when you call tech service for your electronics, they can try to help trouble shoot it over the phone to get some kind of fix. They just don’t default to “well we can just tow it.” With a family of 7, stuck in another city, that wasn’t an option for us. I ended up just disconnecting the battery to reboot the computer system which fixed the problem. Why couldn’t someone at roadside assistance be trained to offer that as a solution. You sell me a $100k car and you don’t have people who can offer support in those situations? That’s just unacceptable.\n",

      "First, the young lady that helped me spoke excellent English compared to my previous experiences with OnStar. I explained we seldom drive our 2014 Impala vehicle and did not want to pay additional $5.00 a month on top of an already large monthly Essentials Plan payment beginning in October. We have never used the Essentials Plan and only have it because we need a plan in order to continue using our Hands Free Calling minutes. All these years we have been told the Essentials Plan is the lowest costing one. However, the young lady explained there is a lower priced Emergency Plan that would still keep us eligible of Hands Free Calling feature. She also asked if I was military and I said \"yes\". Apparently, this makes me eligible for a lower rate and she said I would no longer have to call in every few months to find an affordable rate when the current promotional offer ran out. This young women needs a promotion/more money. She is an excellent customer service rep.\n",

Also, several months ago while trying to purchase additional hands free minutes, I had to make five calls before I could reach someone who found my account and could speak English well enough to charge my account. Very poor customer service. But what prompted the recent calls on 09-09-21 in the first place was the stupid Guardian App that you now have the gall to want to charge me $5.00 extra a month even though I have repeatedly said I do not want or need this idiotic feature. I am incensed that you demand that I pay for something I have no need for. Shame on you.\n",

The representative I spoke to this morning told me I could not get the expiration date extended now, but I could get it extended later by calling back the day after my current service expires. I don't understand why I can't get the expiration date changed to November 30, 2027 now. I love my Bolt. I am hanging in there following all the safety instructions related to the battery (fire) recall and waiting for notification that my car can get its replacement battery installed.

I called onstar via the phone and told her the situation as I wanted more info on what this failure was and how onstar all of a sudden was diagnosing things in my old car. She told me to go to old car call using the onstar button and ask for a full instant diagnostic report to be run. I did that. Agent wouldn’t run that report.

When asked for the card #, I advise the card # didn't change, only exp date, again asked for entire card # & made no acknowledgement that I had not given the same card # that was on file - instead just changed it all. 2. I realized today I gave the wrong card # because it was charged on my acct. I didn't need to make a payment, I needed to update the card info so auto pay would con't. 3. I asked why my bill had increased & was advise the promo had ended, but since the promo was avail I would get the lower cost - why change my amount due if I still qualified? 4. I was advised in Dec 2022 my car will no longer be equipped (2015 e 2G vs 5G) to support OnStar phone service, in which I asked if what I was paying for could be emailed advised no but she could read it to me or it's on my Guardian app. 5. Asked what do I do if I can't call from my car in the event of emergency and was advised to use my phone - my main reason for OnStar was I drive in areas w/out cell service which is what made me want the protection. 5. After the call, I checked my Guardian app, my policy type is blank & offers no info as to what I would be paying for. I'm am going to cancel my OnStar come Dec & am honestly sad to see a safety feature cancelled that I loved knowing I had, even w/out ever needing to use it in the past, but could, if god for bid I was on a trip alone or with my child - we would always be safe and that was 100% worth the cost. I was upset enough to actually start thinking, I could buy a newer car but I'm sure you've seen the price of cars these days & no way am I going to buy another at this time. From what I could find, 5g makes everything run faster, I don't understand if I just wanted the phone service for emergencies why I cannot keep it, if it is currently working on my car but that may be my ignorance on how the \"G's\" work. Between, the payment card not being updating as I requested vs altogether being changed & not made aware when I specifically said same card new exp date that the card on file & card # given were different, then to be charged at that time vs letting my auto pay continue, then learning what's to come, it was a very sad call.\n",

      "Already frustrated with my brand new GMC vehicle having problems multiple times within 3 months, I had to make and Receive a total of 28 calls over a period of 10 hours in order to get my vehicle towed. Ridiculous! I waited for 3 different tow truck companies to arrive one after another before they finally took my vehicle. My entire experience with GMC so far is completely terrible. Every person I spoke to (except for the very first guy I spoke to and the last guy I spoke to) seemed like they didn’t even care. There was no sense of urgency from road side assistance, from the delearship I purchased from or from the tow companies GMC works with. Luckily I was at home when the truck broke down, but my broken down GMC left me stranded to figure out how to get my kids to and from school and I had to miss work. On top of that, I had to find a way to travel all the way to Tempe, which is 30 to 40 minutes from my home to pick up a rental vehicle.\n",

There was nothing I had to worry about & I, (including my husband), was so happy that he did not have to interrupt a very important meeting & leave his job to drive 40 minutes just to come out to get all sweaty & dirty up his white work shirt & suit while changing a dirty tire. Onstar, you all truly saved the day! I’m so happy you guys were there for me, not to mention how rapid everything took place! It all took less than 30 minutes for my rescuer to get to me. And when he arrived, I didn’t have to lift a finger while I safely sat inside of my cool, air-conditioned SUV as my rescuer did all the work, which took only 15 minutes to change out my flat tire. I couldn’t believe how little time it all took! I was VERY impressed and beyond grateful! You guys saved the day in more ways than one! Thank you, Onstar!

Since I'm never sent receipts or confirmation I didn't notice until recently that I'm being charged twice a month. Once for Internet and once for OnStar. Considering I never use any of the services, except by accident, I was expecting at least some kind of refund. The rep was slow and I had already had to talk to two people regarding the situation. Once it became clear the rep was not going to offer any kind of resolution, it was either escalate the call or call it a day. I choose the latter, thus bringing us to where we are now. Me paying for a year and a half, two years of Internet service I don't use and no cheaper options available for the OnStar I also don't use, but might could some day, I'm bitter and frustrated. 0 out of ten and would never recommend OnStar to anybody in their right mind.\n",

He opened up the hood to see if there was a way to put it into neutral but he wasn’t knowledgeable enough to know where to look so he drug it backwards up onto his flatbed with chains. Now I know that this can potentially cause transmission problems, how is it that a person who does towing doesn’t know how to figure out where the switch is under the transmission to put an automatic start car into neutral? He probably does this all day long ! All I did was Google it to find out that there is a switch under the transmission allows you to put it into neutral. I immediately became very concerned and had to call the service department to let them know that they might need to look at the transmission to.

I started one day with $1.87 in my account ( I don’t use my bank account most of the time and haven’t for a long while.) but then next think I know, I’m -$150.00 from overdraft fees. The last woman I talked to didn’t wanna give me my refund. Then I said I need the refund so that my bank will reimburse my overdraft fees. She said she could refund $16. Okay well that still wouldn’t fix my issue. My bank told me if onstar didn’t want to cooperate then I could just turn my account into the fraud department. It being a big company like onstar, it wouldn’t be fraud. But it would get to the bottom of it considering I didn’t use the service but twice. And that was during the free trial. So I told the lady that that’s what my bank is asking me to do since she won’t give me the full refund. She put my on hold and came back and said as a “courtesy” she would refund the 38 dollars and change. She sounded upset and angry with me and I kept apologizing but she didn’t care.

      "I THINK this references a call made yesterday, June 9, 2022, from a location in Indiana. If it isn't about that incident, please ignore my response. My wife contacted OnStar when our 2017 Volt had problems. The problem was similar to one we had with this car in January of this year. The OnStar operator was very helpful. She enlisted A-1 Towing to provide a tow. My wife was given an estimated arrival time for the truck between 12:44 and 12:54, an hour and a half later. My wife received updates as time passed which claimed the truck would arrive when expected. Around 1PM no truck had arrived and she called to see how much longer it would be. The number she called was in a text from OnStar. The person she spoke with told her he had a \"lot of pickups ahead of you.\" That was frustrating. She canceled the call. We attempted to drive our car to the nearest GM dealership, Chevrolet of Columbus. The car was totally dead within a mile and a half. By this time I had come from Louisville, our home town 65 miles away to take my wife to her event. So we had a second car now. We needed to leave the disabled car at the side of the expressway and drive to the next exit where the dealership was. The people at this dealership location were VERY helpful. Unfortunately they're not yet certified to work on electric vehicles. They gave us a local contact for a tow company. The end result was a night in a Fairfield Inn and a $220 tow to Hublar Chevrolet today, June 10. The most frustrating part was that the expectation set by OnStar was not met.\n",

      "The person I spoke to was pleasant and very helpful. However, the individual did not verify the address I gave him. I was on the side of a busy highway so it was understandably loud yet I stated numerous times the address I was giving was only a 17 mile drive away so that it was covered under the 25 mile radius. I gave the customer service rep the address and he then proceeded to state he was seeing a cost for my vehicle to be dropped off at the stated address I gave him. He did not tell me the charge either. He then asked to put me on a hold to figure out why there was a charge. He never once confirmed the address with me before or after putting me on hold. Once he got back from hold he stated the charge was due to the fact my car is still under warranty and must be dropped off at a dealership and that is why there was a charge. So I clarified that even though through ONSTAR I am covered for free under 25 miles of a tow radius that bc the warranty predated my ONSTAR membership that I cannot have the car left at my home but at a dealership which in turn would then cost extra to fix. At this point I was very annoyed and asked what the charge was to deliver it to my home. He stated the charge was over $1,000. I said no way. He says that is the charge for dropping it off to a location over 200 miles away. I now was extremely mad and asked what address he had listed as the one I gave him was again only 17 miles away as I stated at least 2-4 times prior during our initial conversation. He gave me a completely wrong street name and city. This is when I spelled out the correct address I gave him originally. After he apologized and put in the correct address he stated the tow was covered and would work. None of this extra waiting, confusion or frustration if he would have just read back the address originally or asked me to spell it out. If I would have just said yes to the charge that he did not even state the amount of originally, I would have paid over $1,000 AND had my car delivered to a location over 200 miles away. I was very pleased with the call except for this huge issue that could have been avoided. Please ensure your customer service reps are reading back the address and miles away for where the customer is needing their car delivered too. If I ever need a tow again this is something I will be ensuring the reps due to avoid any issue like this ever again.\n",

I cancelled my account as I received no good response to my request to rebate my credit card back to that time.

      "Very poor experience.... I called on 11/29/2021 to add hands free minutes, the advisor took my order for 100 minutes on 2 different vehicles, told me the dollar amount and I approved the purchase. Two days later, I checked my account to see if the minutes had been added, they had not. At that time I was told Hand Free minutes could no longer be purchased as of 11/22/2021 and that ALL customers were notified in October this year. I am so disappointed in Onstar, I was not notified and your own people still said they were available on 11/29/2021. I asked if I could get an email copy of the notification so I could understand what has changed or disabled. Your advisor supervisor told me that was not possible. I was also told I will be able to using the minutes I currently have on my account until they are gone, is this true? At this point I'm not what I have, will the phone still work in an emergency situation? If you were going to make a change it should have been on new vehicles going forward, not on legacy vehicles already using the service for years. Please forward these comments to your Executive Director, I would be happy to discuss this with him.\n",

      "My story isn't positive - I just noticed OnStar billing on my credit card for $34.xx/mo - sadly I hadn't noticed it since it began billing my card several months ago after my free subscription ended - shame on me for not noticing the fee, and for setting higher expectations than I ought to have done on this national service provider believing I would have been notified of a billing change and given the freedom to opt-in/out as so inclined. Undoubtedly, I made a verbal commitment to accept the change 2 years prior during dealership OnStar activation; that notwithstanding, OnStar perhaps being right-yet-doing the right thing proofed too difficult. Seeking to cancel because of unknown billing item, I worked with a friendly advisor who was full of intel, but declined to provide me any grace on the billing even though the service hadn't been actively used by me for untold months, and in particular since the billing started in the spring. I do not blame, nor harbor any ill-will towards the messenger. In the end, I cancelled the service due to dissatisfaction with the process. Thank you.\n",

      "I wanted to cancel my service as I am not really using the service at the moment. I had considered coming back to the service at a later time but the cancellation experience has convinced me to never come back again. I’ve even went as far as deciding I will never buy a vehicle again if they even suggest signing up for onstar as part of the process. The cancellation process is incredibly frustratingly difficult, likely almost illegal in practice. You cant cancel online, or by chat. You have to call in. Problem here is the first few times I tried to cancel I was told that I cannot cancel my service, was hung up on, or tried to transfer to a disconnected line. All while still being charged for the service. I understand that the agents are likely required to run through a script and penalized through KPIs if they cannot retain X% of customers, which usually should not be so obvious. As they say, want to see how confident a company is in their service? Try to cancel. Poor services will make it as difficult as possible to cancel because they know you will never be back. Great services will make it easy because they know you will be back once they realize what they are missing. I actually did enjoy some aspects of the service but Im terrified to join back because of how atrocious the customer service was. I will say though, if you do happen to look at the call logs of my experience the last person I talked to to confirm my cancellation was delightful. If you ever wondered if Detractors truly detract, let me be the answer. Yes, I will actively detract and warn all my friends, family, and colleagues to avoid onstar like the plague.\n",

I went to use the app a day later to track my vehicle. Also, needed to unlock the truck as my wife locked keys in the truck. We depend on this app for security and to start the truck during the hard winter months in Northern Minnesota. Needless to say, I was not a happy person when I was NOT able to use the app!!

      "I very specifically requested follow-up for my concern -- I believe it was THREE times during my second exchange during my first contact. (I say \"exchange\" because my call was escalated from the first agent to a supervisor, so it is the conversation with the supervisor that I am referring to in this comment.) I was dismayed that it took that many specific requests for follow-up, and at one point the supervisor adopted a tone that I interpreted as frustration, which I asked her about, with something along the lines of \"I sense some frustration\" or something along those lines--of course I did not take notes, so I don't know my exact words, but I attempted to remain neutral; she denied that was the case, but her next words were audibly less clipped in tone, so I would say that when I called her on it, she did regroup and collected herself quite professionally, so I do appreciate that. Nevertheless, it did take repeated requests for her to acquiesce and commit to a follow-up call, which was the substance of the exchange between Tammy and myself on the date this survey references. I credit her for: a) finally committing to her calling me back; b) leaving a detailed voicemail when she did follow through with a first attempt to contact me (8/3/21); and c) making the second attempt, when she finally reached me on 8/4. I do feel the matter was resolved, which I appreciate. Please note that my decision to terminate my OnStar plan was not directly influenced by my overall experience with this supervisor or the first agent, or indeed any particular agent I have communicated with in the past.\n",

So I called back and got another rep who was a little more helpful, but not much. Now I find out my OnStar won't work as before without a cell phone, app and plug-in, and have less features at more cost. Dropping HFC and disabling blue button is a big mistake folks. If I need an app and phone, why bother with OnStar? I can google it myself. When my home security system cell communicator went outdated, they simply replace a circuit card and updated to 4G. I'm pretty sure there is a card in the OnStar system that handles communications, why can't it be updated? You may have just lost an 8 year customer, still undecided and very unhappy! I go places where cell service is spotty and OnStar always worked. Not now... Fix it right and update the cell communicator so everything works as is supposed to without app and cell phones.

Each time I have called OnStar to have the charge removed I have been treated very courteously by the representative. Each time I was told the charge would be credited back to my VISA account in 3 to 5 days. When I received the second charge in two months I contacted VISA and they investigated it as a fraud. Subsequently I received notice that the matter had been resolved. This month the representative, who was very helpful, told me there was no note on my file about previous problems. As I see it, the fault is with your billing department and reflects VERY POORLY on OnStar. You need to fix this problem or you will lose customers, including me.

My mom has onstar and has same issue- bad connection and bad service times. In past onstar has always helped me. I had a tire light come on. And in past they have told me which one is the issue and the pressure. First call disconnected while I was driving on highway at high speed, and I was not happy about this. I had to call back. Second call not helpful as in past. She made excuses that the lady before had not hung up, I told her I have been in contact many times via onstar, and she came on after the awaited beep without issue... the lady just hung up. I asked for a supervisor immediately as was not helped at all to levels as in the past. She eventually disconnected me without resolution. I have relied on onstar in past and have seen the service as valuable. I am beginning to wonder about the value now. The reason I pay for it is safety and peace of mind. It takes longer than ever before to connect to someone and thankfully it wasn’t life or death this time when they disconnected. Will have to seriously consider if this is worth it and leaning towards canceling service. I expect someone to reach out to me, which I did request on last call.\n",

They said they would send someone out and got my location, after 45 minutes I called again and the person said she would try again and stay on the line for customer service. I was then put on hold and after 1 hour I was still on hold, being told \"please hold, your call is very important to us\" apparently not too important. My husband came to where I was and then called AAA while I was still on hold. AAA came within 15 minutes and I was just able to get to a 7 o'clock meeting. As I was on my way home after 9 someone from Roadside Assist called to tell me they were on the way (over 4 hours after my initial call). I explained to them what had happened and that I didn't need help any more. The next day I received a call from Sewell Cadillac apologizing for the event. They said Roadside Assist didn't get the call until 9 PM. That is why I cancelled!!\n",

The experience went downhill from there as I was trying to make sense of the plan and future use as the car went to our daughter. I thought I had renewed her plan. It turned out she was without service for months. This is definitely related to my husband’s passing but it would have been nice if you all could have been clearer or more helpful on that. Then my don bought a new trailblazer. He was of course given a free on star trial. He did not utilize the service so intended to cancel. He didn’t know he had to call to cancel so I then was charged nearly $50 a month for 4 months. In the confusion, I thought that money was for my daughter’s 2015 impala, my husband’s former vehicle. Here I was paying for literally nothing. So I called and figured it all out by sitting in a running car in 100 degree weather to cancel these policies. The system needs to be more clear. That being said, we’ve used the service when our keys were locked in the car and for wifi in remote areas.\n",

After performing a system check, he read me the issue associated with my check engine light. I asked him if it was a software calibration issue, which does not need to be addressed within the 7 days. He told me he didn’t know. I thanked him for the info and we ended the call. Two days later the Check engine telltale doesn’t show up any longer, which has been on for a couple weeks.

She said the only way to cancel the order was to cancel the free trial period as well. I said do it and again asked to have my credit card information deleted from the system.

The very next day I upgraded to the maximum level as I was dissatisfied with the speed of the basic level and I was immediately charged the traditional $25 from my bank account. Herein lies my one and only issue, why within one day was I charged as if I had 2 accounts instead of simply up to the upgraded amount or even refunded the $15 in favor of applying the $25 instead? The individual on the phone kept repeating over and over about how the new speed would not take effect until the basic plan expired and I kept repeating back that I understand but that was not my issue. My issue was the back to back bank drafts for the full amounts so after he refused to address my issue i asked to speak with his manager. Putting me on a lengthy hold he came back on several times to see if I was still holding but I persisted in getting a straight answer in this regard. When the manager finally did come on I carefully explained my issue and asked him not to make the mistake of the previous representative by even mentioning when my upgrade would take effect because I felt felt it was a deflection from my core issue which was of course the billing. Once I stopped my very clear explanation the very first thing the manager does is get right into when the new plan would take effect and at this point I just saw red and said well if this is how it's going to be then just cancel the entire service right now because I would just rather do without than deal with this nonsense.\n",

      "The app could be particularly useful when fast charging (DCFC) my Bolt EUV. I usually go in to the store(s) where the fast chargers are located to eat, get a cup of coffee, shop, etc... and the app should let me know my current state of charge, time remaining on charge, or if my charge is interrupted and I need to go back and restart. Unfortunately, the app inconsistently provides this information, which is more frustrating than if it didn't work at all. For example, if the app has recently been working I would be shopping while charging and expecting the app to alert me if charging is interrupted. In actually, I have returned to the charger after shopping for 45 minutes expecting to be fully charged or close to it only to find that the charge was interrupted shortly after initiating and I have to restart again. I can't rely on the app at all. Even when manually refreshing every few minutes, which is not ideal, the app often does not update correctly to show me the current state of charge in the vehicle. I have tried shutting it down, uninstalling/reinstalling, logging out/logging in, etc... and nothing works. The lack of app support makes owning a GM EV very challenging on trips.\n",

Driver than drove us too another shop he new off and was at 3:30 ish Afternoon deer hit us approximately 10:32 am in morning! He dropped us off at a second shop which than was a auto body shop but NOT a authorized dealer for insurance! So we than turned around and called insurance company and insurance company towed us too an authorized auto body shop! And on star sent a Lyft driver too pick us up! Way before the tow truck k got there! We where told leave the car on the side of the road, keys in car, and windows down! I said NO I WILL NOT NOT I the evil times we are all living in!

      "Text communication caused problems. They dispatched one tow company and said they would be there by 2:36pm. Soon after, the tow company contacted me directly saying they would be about an hour and a half later than the original eta. The text notification alerted me that the tow company should be in the area or on site. I texted back that they were not and that they had told me it would be much later. After a seriies of frustrating texts, they dispatched another towing company. They were very slow to update the details of the second company. I had to leave the vehicle, so I requested a call back. They called and said they would be there within like 30 min. At around 5pm, the original tow company picked up my 2022 tahoe. Some time later, another tow company arrived and loaded my 2010 tahoe even though there were no keys and the front two tires were low on air. A neighbor informed me that they were taking it and being extremely rough with it. I called them, and they brought it back. My mother came over to see what was going on. She witnessed the tow company violently shaking the tahoe off the rollback. Now, the tahoe is sitting in my yard with tires completely off the rims and the wheels are scratched up. The driveway is scuffed, there are divots in my yard, and the wheel balancing weights have been knocked off and lying around in my driveway.\n",

Had the battery cable unhooked tried the battery from dying. He wouldn’t touch anything and I had to hook up the battery. I even had to open the door because of his liability issues. He wouldn’t touch or tried to help with anything. Then he said he couldn’t tow my vehicle because my emergency break is locked up. Only thing he can do to call the company that he couldn’t tow it for me because I need a record truck. Which I haven’t hear anything back from them. Had to call my AAA for help. The tech from AAA opened the hood, checked the battery even tried to charge the battery and checked everything if he could get it start the car for me. Then when everything failed, he towed it to the near by dealership. Very bad experience from your service. Not sure if it’s because your company’s policy is too strict or the technician who was uncaring.\n",

A couple months into the membership I got an email stating I sold my vehicle and you terminated my membership. I never sold my vehicle! And had no intention of cancelling my membership. I then contacted member services and after being put on hold every few minutes for lengthy periods of time I was ultimately told they could not reinstate my membership for the same price I signed up with. You raised your price. So OnStar could not honor the agreement/contract YOU made with me! I then had to try to renegotiate the price with member services which I shouldn't have to do! Again I kept being put on hold for long periods of time. After about an hour I reluctantly agreed to the new, higher price and after all that the service rep said she was having technical difficulties and couldn't complete the transaction!

Some things changed in my personal life and I did not buy a new vehicle at that time.

We purchased our new 2022 Chevy Traverse on 7/8/2022. We could not have been more pleased by the way that we were treated by everyone at Parks. We were most impressed with Bear Chisley, our Salesman, and Joshua Henley, Financial Services Associate. We would highly recommend Parks Chevrolet to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle. You will be treated with respect, no pressure, and the highest level of professionalism. If you're looking for a new Chevy, go see the Bear! You will not be disappointed.\n",

It was truly a nightmare. The incident occurred at 7am and my car wasn’t towed till maybe 330 or 4pm.

      "I was unaware of the update, and installed it recently. The security is higher, (requiring a pw for every sign-in), I understand this is to ensure information is protected. The option to \"remember me\" doesn't seem to work and when I do use the app, it is typically to use my navigation through OnStar and am downloading directions to the car. The features appear to be the same and I don't have a need for the Guardian or other options being offered. Change required adapting to new procedures/features. I appreciate keeping the app relevant, easy to use and convenient can be difficult when trying to format security options and protecting the data consistent with legal requirements. I will continue to use the app when needed, and will sign on when I have to, but it would be nice if that feature could be shelved, allowing those of us who use it sporadically to use it easily, while not worrying about losing a phone or alleviating security concerns. I am hesitant be negative so early on, but I believe in communicating my concerns, whether or not they're realistic and fixable.\n",

All the time it kept telling us we didn`t have full OnStar service & when I called on the phone & talked to someone they said due to us paying by check, that was why it was showing that. Then when we talked to OnStar in the truck that day, they said we had not paid last year. Very disappointed due to the price it costs. We have only had to use it 1 time due to a wreck to get help.

The steering wheel, or my steering were not effected but at 40 miles per hour the wheels felt like there were vibrating and creating excessive noise and I didn't feel safe in driving the car. I thought possibly front end alignment, steering rod or whatever was the issue. I took it in late the first day, discussed the issue with Geo and Gary (Service Mgr) they said it was safe to drive and that they couldn't do anything that late in the day but to come back or set up an appointment. I was also scheduled to physically move the next day. Gary suggested I get moved and come back when I was settled. Since it was intermittent it was hard to pinpoint the issue. I moved the next day, and the same issue continued whenever I drove the car. That continued for 2 days. I was going to the dealership and on the way I went by the ATM at Mid-Florida CU, drove through, and after I stopped at the ATM, and pulled out, all was fine, no noise, no hearing the noise that sounded like the tires were coming off, no anything. I still continued to the dealership where Mike (?) at the service center greeted me, followed by Geo and Gary recognizing me and continued to help me.

I gave some of my information to start my free trial, and either the advisor hung up or the call dropped. Next, I used my telephone because I wasn’t sure if onstar had all my info. I was connected to another advisor, as I was explaining my situation, and telling the advisor my bad experience with onstar so far, I believe she hung up on me. Or the call was dropped. Next I tried the the blue call button. Got through to an advisor. Explained situation. This advisor told me that my information was taken and my free trial had already started. So that’s 4 times that I had to take time out my my schedule to set up a service that I will never use. Totally unacceptable. I only activated my trial offer because the dealership where I bought my car from contacted me twice and asked me to please contact onstar and register for my free trial. There must be some kind of deal the dealership has with onstar where the they may get “kickbacks” for how many people are signed up. Not sure. If it weren’t for the dealership bugging me about it, I would have not contacted onstar at all. I’ve had similar issues in the past on a former vehicle where I had an onstar trial.

We really only used it for 2 things. 1 was the locked out service. We only got locked a couple of times. But when we did, within 5 minutes our car was unlocked. But mainly we used On Star when we needed directions. It never took more then 3 minutes for On Star to send out step by step directions to our destination. A voice would help direct us by letting us know how far our next turn would be. An seconds before it would beep. An if we missed a turn it would let us know . Then it gave us a choice to resume directions. We used the map many, many times in ten years. I am buying a new car that equipped with a different service. I am not only recommending anyone to take advantage of the On Star in their vehicle, but recommending it to the person that is purchasing our vehicle.

Following our discussion, the representative said the account would be closed, but that I would not receive a refund for the amount billed after my first call. Again, I had to endure about 5 minutes of sales pitches trying to keep me as a member. I repeatedly said 'no' and that I was now retired and could no longer afford Onstar. Still, no refund.

      "I have a 2017 Chevy bolt premier. I was looking to see its state of charge. There’s a very long delay for the application to get the status from the car. I used the energy screen to do a status update and locate (in combination). That completed in a relatively short amount of time (90 seconds?) but I don’t know if it was because I had already started and restarted the myChevrolet app three times that it finally was able to do that in the energy screen. When I first start the app, it’s basically frozen until I can get a charge status. This might take 10-15 minutes. However, I might be opening it for some other reason; for instance, I might be looking to see when my OnStar services expire, or find/set a dealer. But I have to wait for the status to update in order to use that feature. At least, in my experience. I think that, in the past, I have seen the SOC update on the main screen, but did not see the updated SOC on the Energy page; I had to refresh that page to get the update. This implies that there are multiple local variables tracking the SOC in the app. It seems like it should only store this info in one variable/location, but maybe there is a ‘use case’ for storing it multiple? If I’m at home (or on a ChargePoint station), I can get SOC from the ChargePoint app. That is my fallback. The one time I really wanted to use the app, it worked; we were getting a ton of snow, I was at a medical clinic and my car was parked too far away for remote start with the fob; I was able to remote start using the app.\n",

We waited in the hot Georgia sun for more than 5 hours for a tow truck having to turn the car off and on for air conditioning. We were on the phone with roadside assistance for more than 3 hours which I documented on my cell phone before help was even dispatched. OnStar never reached back out to even see if we were ok. We pay for the peace of mind that OnStar provides but when we were stranded on the side of the road with our two children, hours from home, in an unfamiliar and unsafe place, you not only let us down, you did NOTHING to help us. We had taught our two young children that in the event of an emergency, they can push the OnStar button and receive help. They witnessed that when you push the OnStar button, you are actually told you are on your own and given a roadside number to try to call yourself which we waited on hold for hours. So disappointed. The lack of service and care is not only terrible but it is also dangerous. I can't believe that when we actually needed your service, no one was able to help. We want a refund.

      "The tow truck driver arrived late and claimed I was in the “wrong” place. I was in the exact place I told the original operator I was in. He wanted to face time me and kept calling me honey and sweetie. Eww! Then I waved him down he put the parking break on then told me to get in the car and keep the wheel straight while he pulled it up on the truck. The parking break would not go off. Then he told me to stay in the car as he leaned over my lap and tried to get the brake off, lingering there- eww again! I said “let me out and you try.” He couldn’t get the parking break off. Then he tried jump starting the car and it came on. I said, “should I just drive it to the dealership myself rather than have you tow it. He said that’s fine for 65 dollars cash. He said a tow is free but I need 65 dollars cash for you to take your car. I was puzzled because I thought I had roadside assistance. So I started to call the assistance line and he said who are you calling. I told him. He jumped in my car pulled it in the truck and said, “I’ll tow it to the dealer. You are good honey you don’t owe me any money.” He drove away. So after standing outside in the scorching heat in high heels, I called for a Lyft. Once I got home- which is farther away than the dealership. I called the dealership. They did not have my car. Over an hour later they called my husband to say the car was there but it won’t start. The dealership I asked the car to be taken to still has not called 24 hours later to tell us what is going on with the car. We depend on the vehicle to go to work! Please stop sending this tow company when a woman is alone. I was not only uncomfortable, I was scared!\n",

      "I called initially to confirm when I would be billed after the trial ended and was told that I wouldn’t be billed until July 2023. I was billed within a couple weeks of that call. Called again to inquire and cancel the service. The operator was a bit defensive saying that I had two services and only one was extended until 2023. I told her that the other rep I spoke to before the charge told me I had no charges coming due soon and she never made a distinction between the two services. I received an apology for the confusion, but no offer of a refund. I canceled both services and will not use OnStar again. I’ve been sharing my experience with others so they know not to trust OnStar either. I plan to lodge a complaint to the BBB. At this point I feel I’ve been lied to and stolen from.\n",

Secondly, I tried to download the guardian app and was never able to get logged in EVEN WITH an onstar advisor on the call with me. Apparently there is an issue with previous accounts migrating to this new system, thirdly, when I asked for the diagnostic to be emailed, I was assured it would \"be there in 5 minutes\"....which never happened. The service and program has gone straight to hell! It's almost worthless! With my previous app (my Cadillac app) I could see my mileage (since I have to keep track of that for work- Apparently not on the guardian app) I could lock/unlock my vehicle with just the touch of a button- not on guardian. I also could sound the horn/flash lights. None of these features are available on the new app....so why should I spend the money? So if I'm in an accident I'll get a call? That happens rarely. Do people lock their keys in the car? Frequently. Do they sometimes forget where they park in a big parking lot? Frequently! Honking horn might help you find your car more quickly. The new guardian app will end up putting you out of business. It offers nothing user friendly\n",

I was towing my travel trailer with my wife and 3 kids. First tow estimated 11:15-11:45am pickup. That changed companies to 12:45pm pickup. Mind you it’s 115 degrees outside with no air conditioning. I asked to ride with the truck to the dealership, the tow truck driver showed up with family and no room for me around 1:45pm over 4hrs in the desert with my children. I had no ride to the dealership, roadside said for my family I could call a ride share company. I was left high and dry. Not sure why it took so long and why it couldn’t have been towed to a local Chevy dealership instead a GMC dealership 50 miles away. I called the GMC dealership which was very nice and they said they would diagnose the truck that day. Well my truck which was an hour away took 2.5hrs to get there? Not sure where my truck went since I couldn’t ride with it. I had to rent a uhaul to take my trailer and family somewhere since GM wouldn’t tow my trailer or provide a ride for me and my family. What a complete fail. Also my kids and I almost had to go to the hospital for heat exhaustion.\n",

I was asked for exact location but when I'm driving I do not know the address. I asked for akindercare in denville. Because I wasn't driving yet I had to look it up. All connecting roads were closed due to road paving and as no map showed up on my screen, I had to stop and ask for directions to find my way out. Went in the wrong way to a dead end and again as no map in star didn't work. I was told on star saves my last 5 locations which is a start but there are some addresses I go often but don't know the house number so I'm left wondering if that would be there if I needed it while driving. I'd rather use an app then speak to someone, ever! No I don't want to chitchat with a human when I'm juggling many thing and maps is a great option for me so far. I will try it during my trial phase but so far it is not helpful I also don't like how my screen doesn't show a full map.

      "3 different tows were dispatched. The first said that they completed the job while never showing up. I had to call to get another tow dispatched. The gentlemen said he needed to call me back so he had time to secure a tow. One hour later, after not hearing anything I called to follow up. The tow was dispatched according to the 'system' although the tow compabny said no one accepted any jobs. After an hour of waiting and back and forth with the 3rd rep, she finally secured a tow. From the time I called to the time the tow came was about 4 hours. Its frustrating to have a brand new car with 500 miles on it let alone going back and forth securing a tow at midnight. I have two kids the oldest of which is three and to say their bed time was interrupted would be an understatement. If i did not follow up I would still be waiting, literally...

Thankfully I was close enough to home and my husband came to the rescue. Had to bring the tire in to be fixed again. So I’d say the service guy should have known better what to do. Also he couldn’t put my spare tire on as he was struggling to get the spare out from under the truck. I spent time with him on you tube trying to figure it out to no avail. The service guy was very nice and very professional but definitely had a struggle with my tire and was not experienced at all with my vehicle. As he left I was appreciative and was happy until I got on the road and the tire began to lose air yet again. Overall the ease to reach the assist service was very easy and the service person came and was professional and respectful but my issue was not resolved as he had thought and caused me a lot of worry as I got back on the road. This is my first Cadillac and I can say at the time this happened, I wished I was in my BMW with my run flats!\n",

I over-looked the high cost for my love and loyalty to chevy hoping yall put it to use other than laughing to the bank. I get it live service costs money, programs cost money, algorithms cost money, I get it I really do. But 50 bucks a month for stuff I take note of anyways? Cmon now. Plus the oil change stuff is almost irrelevant I gotta keep hitting the reset button and I know I'm half wayish to an oil change. Mobil 1 extended performance FOR THE WIN here. (Blackstone will back me up as they did with my hard driving on a wrx I still had decent oil life at 12k so 10k on a shitbox is more than generous lmao) I get it that's whatever oil y'all use at the dealership and make money on service.. I get it. But you may get my service with this jatco transmission yikes am I scared for the long run here. But I got a truck and trailer for when the time comes anywho. Tpms and discount tire got me covered with tire issues. 2 bent rims tho by 30k jeez texas roads what can I say.. made it to discount tire ahah. Why did my 03 Lancer make more power and get better fuel economy than a new chevy shitbox? Who knows. Nonetheless my rant is complete with a closing statement 10 bucks a month still ain't worth it to me but that's where I would value the complete package. Maybe 5 bucks without the people to find a stolen car that's a pretty good uneasy feeling sale. They usually cut power to them things park in a building where you can't find it anywho.\n",

Called again and insisted you send a tow truck with a bed you said it would be 45 min. The tow truck driver called and said it would be more like two hours. I was stranded on the side of the expressway for over 5 hours! Our dealership said they had someone ready to come pick me up early on but I had to call roadside back first. When I did and asked if Jake Sweeney could come pick me up they said no that is not how this works, they are calling someone from a lot further away.

It was currently active in the truck under the old owners, but I wanted to switch it into my name. (I also own a 2017 GMC Acadia and have the data plan for that vehicle, so I already have an account.) I first called the on-star number from my cell phone, and was told that I needed to go to the vehicle and press the blue on star button. After doing this and explaining what I wanted to do, I was transferred to either 5 or 6 different agents. This took well over an hour while I sat in my hot vehicle. Each agent continued to say they couldn't help and switched me to somebody else. The next to the last agent I spoke with I thought might have me taken care of, but when I ask if I needed to supply a credit card number or if they could use the card I already on file on my account for the Acadia, thats where I got transferred to the last agent. (Keep in mind each time I had to completely explain to each of them what I wanted done.) The last agent I spoke with was very hard to understand. I'm sorry, but I finally had to disconnect as I could not understand him and we were at like 1 hour and 15 minutes at this point. I then went inside my house and called on star by telephone again. I immediately ask for a supervisor. It took the supervisor appx 10 minutes to finally get on the line. I explained all of this to the supervisor. I'll have to admit, she was very friendly and tried to help, but she was having problems getting the data plan set up on my new vehicle. She said that she kept getting error messages. She said that she would continue to work on it. I told her that I have had my fill of waiting and ask if she could call me back if and when she got it working. She said she would, but it might take several days. This all occurred Friday evening, 09/17/2021 between 5:15pm and 6:30pm. I still don't know if I have a data plan in the truck.

I was told that they would only send a tow truck for free if it was going to go to an authorized dealer. Well from where I live and where the accident occurred the closest dealer was twice as far away as the shop I wanted to go to and where I lived. If they’re telling them I have to call back to find out if I can get a tow truck a different way I was unsuccessful and had to call back . I was then informed that as a ”one time courtesy “ they would waive the towing fee to the body shop. I don’t know if it makes a difference when it is just a mechanical issue that the car broke down or something along that line but when I was in the situation where the car was undrivevable and in an accident whether it was my fault or not, I don’t understand why I would have to be penalized for having the car taken to a location that was literally a 10 minute drive instead of going the opposite direction well over 30 minutes away. That being said I was still very appreciative that they were able to take care of me and even though I had to wait a little while longer than I expected for the truck to reach me, that is something that I cannot place the blame on GMC roadside assistance.

I have used your OnStar for 15 years and possibly longer. It is a great feature for those of us who are responsible. I have extra minutes that should have rolled over and now that hands free is gone, those minutes should be returned or credited to my GM points I receive for service.Not just rip me off for dollars spent that your agent could have suggested I not buy that plan. That would have been fair. When GM was an American company employing my neighbors up and down my street and across our city you would never have been sneaky because it would not have been accepted. I feel no loyalty to Mexican GM cars! The all mighty dollar breaking up families, families declaring bankruptcy due to taking their jobs to Mexico. Generations had employment with your company.

I was ver upset with this and I called onstars customer service,I spoke with a very intelligent woman to clear up this MISTAKE and she did a great job trying to get things in perspective. The customer service rep I spoke with was having difficulty understanding the PAST MISTAKES THE OTHER CUSTOMER SERVICE REP NOTED IN MY ACCOUNT. IT CLEARLY STATED \"NO CHARGES TILL SEPTEMBER\" So I had to ask WHY DID ONSTAR CHARGE ME 39.98 ON JUNE 16TH 2022 She didn't have an answer nor could she give me one. So I elected to eliminate my account and onstars services they provided to me for over 7 years on 2 vehicles and request a refund of the 39.98. The refund was given back,(thank you) and onstars services were terminated as well. What confused me is why I was not offered or granted the REMAINDER OF MY SERVICES? FYI. TREATING LOYAL CUSTOMERS IS ESSENTIAL TO A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS, IM SADDEN that we have had to part ways as I've been a loyal customer for 7 years,onstar has never had any problems withdrawing the fee for services from my credit union,but I've have problems from onstar charging me for FREE BONUS SERVICES THATS BEEN AWARDED TO ME FROM DEALERSHIPS AND YOUR OWN CUSTOMER SERVICE REPS.\n",

      "On July 28, we were involved in a one vehicle accident. The airbags were not deployed but extensive damage to the truck was involved. We called OnStar to get a tow truck to pull us from the ditch and were met with someone who could not understand what we were saying nor could the individual give us any assistance. We were transferred twice to other people only to be asked the same questions... mileage on vehicle, etc. We were against a tree, leaking gas with a completely blown out tire, and extensive damage to the driver's side of the truck. Had it not been for an individual who had heard the impact we might have never gotten assistance. When we ended the call we were asked to evaluate their helpfulness... REALLY? A tow truck was eventually contacted apparently but not in a very prompt manner. We were VERY displeased with the response to our accident. As Senior citizens we need this type of service to assist us in emergencies, but if this is all we get besides GPS service which is available FREE on our phones then it isn't worth the price. Since the vehicle is not operable we have temporarily suspended our service but we are truly displeased with this incident!!!\n",

When I got through I was first greeted with the electronic recording of we no longer do traffic reports. Then I was told that there was no one on staff that evening who could explain to me why that is, and that it had just changed and the person I was speaking to had only found out herself because another customer had informed her of it. Stop giving us crap we don't want and charging us for it (onstar app I am looking at you specifically!) I don't want that crap, I don't, and won't use it and I don't want to pay for it. If you can't stop cutting services I do want and giving me things I don't, then you can stick your service in your ear and I won't subscribe. I might even stop being a GM customer entirely because of this. My wife's BMW doesn't do that and their telematics model is quite good.\n",

She couldn't get my phone connected and it was my fault. My salesman at the Biggs dealership set it up for me and called it \"My Vehicle\", then we named my Husband's phone \"Your Vehicle\" and we were trying to set up both phones on the same site and it didn't work. On our first stop when my Husband exited the phone, I got my connected right away by calling his \"Your Vehicle\".

She doesn't feel comfortable using the Onstar function in the car, so I called your phone number. I can't begin to tell you how frustrating it is using your terrible phone menu system. You need to clean that up and make it much more user friendly. Also response time to get someone to look at the car was quoted as one to two hours or longer!!!??? As it turned out I was able to jump start the car and my wife was able to drive safely home. The following morning I called the onstar phone number again and it took two attempts to be able to speak to an agent, again ridiculously terrible phone menu!!! I advised the agent to cancel a rescue / tow appointment I had made the night before as it was no longer needed, she told me she did that.

      "Those I talked to on the phone were very pleasant and helpful. The entire experience was unsatisfactory due to the fact that I was charged for services I DID NOT use during what was supposed to be a FREE trial. I first called on about 4/28/22 and stated I wanted to cancel. I was told I had two more months free. I called again on 6/28/22 and again stated that I wanted to cancel. However, during the month of June I incurred two charges, one for $15.00 and another for $37.44. And there have been two charges made to my wife’s credit card in the amount of $8.56 each, and we have NEVER given OnStar that credit card information (an investigation into those charges has been initiated). As far as I’m concerned, when I called on 4/28 and said I wanted to cancel, that should have taken care of the entire matter. And since it was a FREE trial, I should NEVER have been charged. You are lured in by this sweet talking sales pitch when you by the vehicle, and then it takes way to much effort to try to cancel it. And then I am charged for a FREE trial. I will never agree to trial OnStar again.\n",

The car had not been used in 5 days and I had not touched the settings for weeks so I did not understand why I got the email. The email contained a phone number to call but the menu system did not include any options that were relevant. As a result, I had to go down to my car and use the OnStar button to access service. The representative could not find an explanation other than the fact that I let my subscription expire (months ago) which meant that I did not have access to certain features. The bottom line is that the email was misleading and caused me to waste close to half an hour trying to understand the cause which was still not resolved. I do not blame the representative, he was polite and did his best. What annoys me is whatever OnStar policy caused a confusing email to be sent.\n",

      "After leaving my truck that is less than a month old with less than 1000 miles on it in my driveway while I was on a trip for 2 weeks when I arrived back the battery was dead. Called road side service they dispatched a flatbed wrecker, said it would be about an hour took about an hour and 45 minutes to arrive. Since the battery was dead there was no way to put the truck in neutral so tow truck driver got his booster pack out and hooked it to battery. Only problem was his booster pack wasn’t fully charged so it wouldn’t jump start the truck. I hooked a trickle charger up to it with his booster and still not enough to get it to turn over. Tow truck driver didn’t have regular jumper cables on his truck so I had my wife get some from my warehouse and drive them to my house. We then proceeded to jump my truck off with her Jeep and my jumper cables. I than drove my truck to the dealership. So basically I could have saved minimally 3 hours and jumped it off myself. Bonus the machine said there was nothing wrong with the battery according to the GM test that they ran. Seems odd that a brand new truck with a brand new battery can’t sit for 2 weeks. Battery on both my charger and the tow truck drivers booster pack registered 4.7 volts. So basically they said battery was fine after I drove it 25 miles to them and the alternator charged it.\n",

Now that we are elderly with medical issues and living in Florida which is known for storms we have renewed onstar every year. At the beginning of my conversation with the rep about renewal I asked would she roll over my minutes which she said yes. It wasn't until.after I paid for my renewal I found out rolling over minutes was only for 3 months. I was very disappointed in this change and further disappointed it was not made clear up front. I was later told by someone in the loyalty department I can call in 3 months and see about continuing my minutes. In times like now where money is tight and your service is in my eyes a luxury I'm surprised you are offering less and doing nothing again in my eyes to help loyal customers like even rolling minutes over for at least 6 months!\n",

The person had an accent end it was hard to understand. How am I to use my phone? It is a feature on my car and I am not happy that I can’t get minutes to use my phone. I was shocked to hear this especially when I was in need at the time to make a call. I was never notified of this change. We called back to OnStar when I got home and they said I could make an emergency call and onStar would place that call. I don’t feel calling my husband is an emergency call or calling my children but they are calls that I need to make. I don’t understand why I should have to speak to someone at Onstar to place my call when I could just call my husband myself in the past. I am very upset about this in need someone to explain this new procedure. Also I am upset that I was not notified. I was told an email was sent to me but I never received one and even went back and looked. Hands-free calling was part of purchasing my car and now you have made it harder for me to use and maybe not at all. Why did this happen? If you happen to call me with a response I need someone without an accent as I have a hearing disability and therefore had someone with me when we placed the call from my home.\n",

I was contacted by the first company, with an ETA of an hour, then they delayed another hour then they canceled. Later the second company called with an ETA of about 90 minutes, 4 hours later they called saying they had a police call they had to divert to, and would have to wait until 9 the next morning. They didn’t have to do that, the person at the accident scene can simply call for the next available tow. An hour later they called again saying they would have to reschedule for 9 the next morning. About 9, a third tow company arrived and took the car to the dealership. It took about 24 hours for a tow to arrive. Not impressed at all with a service I pay for on 3 vehicles.\n",

I was told I couldn’t cancel it until the day it ran out, but in the TOS it says that I have the right to cancel anytime, so she clearly was going against the TOS to keep me subscribed. I was on the phone with her for 20-30 minutes talking about why I couldn’t cancel. She kept telling me how no one could cancel the subscription as it has already enabled and that it was impossible to cancel before the renew date. The third person I talked to was able to cancel it in 3 minutes on the phone. Very unsatisfied that I was lied to directly from a customer support staff member.\n",

Originally, the dispatch for the rescuer that was being sent confirmed all of my contact and vehicle information. All was good except when they confirmed my cell phone number. The dispatcher kept adding an extra digit to my phone number. I repeatedly told her about the error and she continued to confirm it back with the added digit. Finally, the dispatch employee confirmed the correct phone number. I then started to receive text messages detailing the travel time of the rescuer. They obviously had the correct phone number since I received multiple text updates. I then received a text message that the rescuer had arrived. Unfortunately, there was no one from the service at my location. I called back @ 844-304-5440 to tell them that no one had arrived. I was then told that the service dispatch had been cancelled since the phone number that the driver had was incorrect. Some how that individual had the incorrect 11 digit phone number that I had to correct multiple times when talking with the woman at the dispatch center. I was told that they would have to start the process over. I had to call back a few more times to beg them to please get someone assigned to my rescue request. Finally someone arrived. Very frustrating that the cause of the cancellation and the delays was due the incorrect entry of my phone number. Love On Star...not the local service that they sent me to for actual roadside service.\n",

The ranger came within five min. However when he arrived he gave gas but didn't have jumping cables. So I then had to wait and additional forty min for this sub contractor from Buick to show up and when he finally came. He didn't have anything saying he was a responder on just some man that woke up out of his bed in regular clothes in a regular car with dollar tree cables that wouldn't even charge the car for a min it gave it enough juice to where I could unlock the car. Open MY trunk and use my own jumping cables because neither the ranger nor the Buick sub contractor had the proper equipment. Very disappointed in my experience with BUICK.

      "Overall, it's a great product, but I have two concerns. The first is that when you press the blue button seeking routing to a specific address, it doesn't seem as though you're speaking to a real person. It seems automated, & sometimes doesn't understand your request. At that point, a real person steps in. In some cases, the system ignores the street address you've given, but recognizes the city & routes you there generally, but not to the specific address. My second concern is routing. On a trip just completed to Fargo, ND & it's twin town Moorhead, MN, we had an intermediate stopover in Sioux City, IA. On the way both to & from Sioux City from here in Hot Springs, AR, we were routed off of I-29 & out into secondary roads. There's nothing out there except corn fields & tiny town cops hoping to write you a radar trap ticket. More than 100 miles of nothing & no opportunity to refuel. I-29 to Nebraska 2, over to Hwy 75 S, to Hwy 36 & back to I-29. Maybe there was an issue with that stretch of I-29, but I wasn't aware of any. Anyway, I've had other trips also, where I was routed on secondary roads. I don't like that; I much prefer staying on the Interstate system as much as possible, even if it's a few more miles, it's safer, there's more services available, & you're less likely to run into a cow on the road.\n",

      "The Chevrolet app didn’t open my vehicle after working correctly a couple of times when I was 90 minutes away from home visiting friends. It took over three hours for OnStar to arrive and they never showed up to open my vehicle so I had to call auto club. Thank God I’m still a member of Auto Club. Your rap is terrible. I cannot rely on your app ever again. I’m pretty technological and your app periodically works to open and unlock my car. Moreover, OnStar was unable to open my vehicle after I purposely left the keys inside thinking the app would work just fine to open my vehicle. There’s something clearly wrong with the electrical system on this new car also the car is missing a couple of chips. It’s a shame that Chevrolet without my knowledge shift vehicle missing chips. Moreover, the charging plate and all electrical outlets become increasingly hot when used. For example, using the charging plate overheats my phone after 30 minutes when trying to charge it. Your application is terrible. I’ve been buying new cars for over 30 years and I found two suburbans in the past that were wonderful. Chevrolet has clearly went down. The quality of the vehicles sucks. Your application is worse. Moreover, your aren’t star systems based in the Philippines and I can’t understand a word that the technicians were saying and the roadside service were saying. I will never buy a GM car or any vehicle again from Chevrolet. Look forward to selling this vehicle once I have all the corrections made by Chevrolet.\n",

      "On my first call into GMC Roadside assistant I gave the rep my location of Northdale Blvd and Dale Mabry hwy in the WaWa parking lot. The rep said that she sees the WaWa at 4041 DM. I told her that was not the correct WaWa that I was at 15524 DM. She stated that she sees that WaWa and that she would send my request to a company to respond. Shortly I received a text stating that Auto recovery solutions would be responding. Within a couple of minutes I received a text from them saying that a tec would be on the way in approximately 1 hours. Approx 1 hour later the tec called me and said he was in the WaWa and didn’t see me. I asked where he was and he was at the WaWa at 4041 DM not the one at 15524 DM. He stated that he was on the way to me. Approximately 30 minutes later I received a text from his company saying that my request was cancelled due to a wrong address for me to call back in to GMC for a new request. So I started over and this time they got it right. Within 30 the tec from Ready to go, (think that’s the company) responded and did a great job.\n",

      "I purchased the WiFi package last month and it hardly worked. The Onstar agent said they had to reset the code and it should be fine. Well the day I called my subscription renewed and the WiFi still continues to go in/out which is ridiculous since they reset the code. I asked if I could cancel it since I'm not getting the service I'm paying for and was told if they cancel I would loose the service that day. So I'm paying for a service that doesn't work properly and If I cancel now I loose the partially working service as well as the remainder of the month which I already paid. So it seems the only one that benefits is Onstar. I didn't even get any type of reimbursement for a service that barely worked last month and still barely working this month. I will definitely be canceling 3dys before it renews and won't be getting it again.\n",

      "You asked. (1) I seldom use the app because it requires log in with password every time I try to access from my phone. Previously I had to use a pin number to log in. (2) When I do go through the trouble of logging in there is nothing of value besides vehicle locate. (3) The app has no connection to the actual vehicle operation, current operating, and what services may be needed. For example, tire pressure shows up on the actual car dashboard, but as far as the app is concerned tire pressure is \"good to go\" even when it isn't. Everything is \"good to go.\" I've had repairs for issues that the \"diagnostics\" on the app never reported. (4) There does not seem to be a consolidated service record on the app or anywhere anywhere else. This year I took the car to a different GMC dealership and it was as if the car had never been serviced (there were no records besides the paper file I keep). I am comparing the overall experience to that of Honda, where I don't use an app but can access all service records online - for ten years. If anyone at GMC actually used the app, vs contracting the development of an app and thinking that the job is done, I imagine none of these issues would exist. Nobody needs another app on their phone, another login and password, and another email survey, unless the actually delivers a valuable service. It's infuriating to be asked by GMC to do their job for them.\n",

I asked to speak with a supervisor, and was repeatedly assured that one would call me within 24 hours despite my insistence that I'd like to hold for one. I was not called by a supervisor.

I did not want to sign up or be charged, and was assured that I would not be charged for anything, and I would be contacted twice at the end of the trial in case I did want to sign up for a plan. After the month was up, my app stopped working. I was never contacted, but was charged $7.99 a month for a plan that didn't even offer use of the app, beginning in March.

The first one called hours after the tow was dispatched and I received notice they would arrive within an hour...I called the number provided and was told there was one car ahead of me (after waiting the hour and the text link said the job was completed) The tow guy called at about 10:38P.M.

Next day first thing I call for another tow and was told they would be here within 240mins. Once the time had past I called the number provided and it went to no one.

She told me that the towing company due to Covid may not let me ride with them and I would be responsible for getting off the highway on my own. The customer representative told me they would give me some taxi services to call I felt that that something that should be taken care of by customer support not myself. Other problem I had was they tried to locate my position with GPS and it gave an address on a street nearby but not on the interstate where I was located when I tried to explain this it was not well received or should I say explained to the towing company.

I was in Hampton, SC and I had to call several times to get direction bc you kept sending me to a non-address. Now granted, Hampton is a mess. The street signs are largely missing or sun-bleached out to the point you can’t read them. And the streets have that crazy east-west designation that gets confusing. Essentially your system kept sending me west when it should have been East and vice versa. Eventually one of your techs got on the phone with me and while she was always politie and did not overtly say anything rude or anything, it was also clear from her tone that she was losing patience, particularly when I told her the truth, that there was no sign marking many of the streets she was telling me to look for. I actually finally figured it out on my own by going to a point west of the court house that corresponded to the point east of the court house that y’all kept sending me. So most of it was Hampton. Their street signs are a mess. Flipping Murdaugh country, what would we expect? But it also does seem like y’all are slipping a little.

      "The key issues I had were getting the customer service agents to (a) copy down enough detail on my location to get the tow truck to the right place (sending a tow truck to \"Denver Internal Airport\" is not helpful when an airport like that has dozens of multilevel garages with tens of thousands of parking spaces); and (b) pay attention to the fact that the vehicle had a locked steering column and could not be put into neutral. I had to wait 1.5 hours for the first truck, and when the guy showed up, he was in the wrong type of truck (roll-back), so I then had to wait ANOTHER 1.5 hours for a different service to show up with a truck equipped with the lifter and dollies necessary to tow my vehicle in the condition it was in. That was a very frustrating waste of time which could have been easily avoided if the customer service agents were paying attention and passing along the information necessary to exactly pinpoint my location (which I provided more than once) as well as the information necessary to ensure the towing service arrived with the right equipment (which I also provided more than once).\n",

I was told it would be over two hours before a tow truck could get to me. Maybe you think it’s better to give an estimate that’s well over the amount of time it should be but I think it’s better to give a real estimate. When the police pulled up behind me and said I was in a dangerous spot and needed to find a tow truck that could get to me sooner I did what he said because I looked at the estimate and it still said over two hours. My plan was to cancel as soon as the other truck got there. The other truck got to me within about 15 minutes for a $95 towing fee (I broke down less than 3 miles from the dealership) and then the OnStar tow truck pulled up less than 5 minutes later. I had just checked the stupid thing that was supposed to update me and it still said two hours. You need to either truly update in real time or something because I am not happy that I had to pay $95 to be towed when I could have waited. My whole family has AAA and they are all telling me to drop OnStar. I’m going to go look at new cars today (won’t go near a Buick if someone pretty much gives me one).

      "I have never experienced the kindness that was shown to me the day I broke down. The man that showed up, I think his name was Mike, not only did he do his job, but he went above and beyond his job! I was by myself and he had ask me if I was gonna be \"ok\", once he left? I said, \"yes\"! But, he took it upon himself to offer me to sit in his air condition truck because it was very hot & humid, I said, \"no, that I would be fine sitting on the curb & waiting for my son to pick me up\". He said, \"well, I'm not leaving\", and he sat on the curb with me while I waited for my son. This man was so concerned about my safety that he would not leave me by myself. NEVER, EVER have I met a complete stranger that was so nice, kind and concerned about my well being. He also, helped me put my stuff in my son's car when he showed up. So, if I was asked, from 1 - 10, what would I rate this person? I would give him 1,000!!! His Momma raised him right!!! Thank you to all that helped me that day. Debbie Everett\n",

      "Please see email below that I just sent to Tom Peacock regarding my experience. Hello All, I am emailing because I am beyond dissatisfied with the lack of care my car has received. I know it is not you guys personally, but you guys are put in place to prevent issues, as the one’s I am having. Please see below a timeline: Monday 8/29: I brought my vehicle in for a purge pump failure (engine light was on). I was told on Wednesday 08/31 that my car was ready for pick up, that the purge pump was fixed, but they also found a leak around a seal in the area of the driver side axle, which I was confused about to begin with because I would have known if my car was leaking anything, as this would have been noted on my garage floor. Wednesday 8/31: I brought my car home from Tom Peacock and backed it into the garage as always and noticed a good amount of a pinkish tinted fluid on my garage floor. My husband thought maybe this was just due to a sloppy job, so we watched this overnight. Thursday 9/1: I went into work, backed into my spot as always, when I noticed there were smaller drops of fluid coming from my car. I then looked under my vehicle and noticed a very large amount of a pinkish fluid under my vehicle. I then immediately went into work and called the service department. This day my car was picked up via tow truck and taken backed to the service department. Friday 9/2: I received notification that my vehicle was ready that the issue was that my transmission fluid was overfilled causing the excess of fluid to come out of a vent hole. This was supposedly fixed and the underside of my vehicle was supposedly washed clean. I received an apology from Mr. Young, left the dealership and headed home. Now for the reason of this email: I have completely lost all faith in Tom Peacock service to care for my car any further and I am not sure where to turn at this point. MY CAR STILL HAS A LEAK OF SOME SORT!! When I backed my vehicle into the driveway, I got out to assess if there was any leaking, knowing there should not have been as I was reassured the issue was fixed. Well there was something dark that had leaked from my vehicle. I wanted to make sure I wasn’t losing my mind, so I moved my vehicle further down in the driveway, placed it in park and got out and looked. Sure enough, there was some fluid leaking out. I moved my vehicle to the street because I do not want my driveway stained, leakage was noticed there as well. I am infuriated to the point that I am nervous to even move my vehicle because I do not know what else could be wrong with it. Granted, there is not as much as the previous days, but still something leaking when I was assured by Mr. Young that nothing outside of condensation from my A/C should be leaking from my vehicle. I fully believe at this point, this “Leak” was caused by incompetent mechanics. I told myself I would not bring up this issue again, as I like to move on from things and not dwell, but I was sent off from your dealership service department missing a lug from my vehicle some time last year as a result of more incompetent employees that did not think enough of my safety to make sure all of my lugs were placed back on my car. And what was most alarming, the guy admitted that he was aware of this issue. What happened was is they did not find my wheel lock in my glove box where it always is and pried my lug off, resulting in a scratch to my rim. This was rectified by purchasing me another rim, but because I am once again dealing with careless mechanics that could do this to others, I am deciding to send this email. I do not know what needs to be done to correct this wrong, once again, as I am hesitant to even bring my vehicle back there, but something has to be done. Please see attached pictures. The dirt you will see is from the first day where we covered the leaked fluid. Stephanie Mitchell 713-857-1521\n",

      "The advisor quickly answered my call. I hadn't moved my car for about two weeks, so wanted to get it out of the garage and hit the ONStar button for a report. He quickly offered to run a report on the engine and a few other systems. All sent to my email. I walked into the house for a quick check, and all was there for me to review. I thanked him for his help, and he asked if he could do anything else for me. I forgot his name. I always worry about getting my monthly report because my car is older with low mileage. I don't drive very much anymore. I enjoy it when I do! That's the only reason that I drive at all is OnStar and the security of knowing someone will help, if needed!

      "This was the most terrible experience I have ever had with a service provider. I called for roadside assistance was told they would be there in 30 minutes after the 30 minutes I checked on the status and it had been canceled. I called back again and they didn’t know why it had been canceled. I called and asked for a new tech to be sent out. It took almost an hour to get someone assigned to us. Then, when they did come out they were only authorized to check the battery when I still had electric components working on the vehicle. The battery was fine and I had told the person this. I had to call back for a tow authorization they wanted to tell me back to San Diego which was 85 miles away instead of to El Centro which was only 32 miles away. Because the tow truck driver they dispatched was too expensive they wanted to dispatch a new one. I had already been on the side of the road with three kids and 100° plus weather for four hours. They told the tow truck driver to leave me and the kids on the side of the road while they dispatched a cheaper tow service. This was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I actually ended up paying the $500 tow personally because I was not going to ask my kids to get out of the tow truck, have the tow truck driver release the vehicle back to the side of the road and wait for a new provider.\n",

      "With the change in service regarding 2G, On-Star has basically eliminated the featuresss that made it worthwhile to me such as hands free phone an all the other features accessible from the mirror controls. I am told no that I have to get an app an an adapter and operate through my phone. So much for hands free. I do not have blue tooth in my car. I was also told by my “Customer Retention Rep” that my phone minutes were wiped out on December 7 because the system no longer supports them. In the next breath she tells me that I could get some “complimentary” minutes. That din’t make sense to me. I was under the impression from an email you sent me that I would be notified when all the changes were about to happen.. To further add to my woes, I was quoted a price of $249 for a year of the Safety and Security plan. For the past 2-3 years I was given what they called a “6 for 6“ plan which was basically the Safety and Security Plan for half price. So my question was, what does this plan offer me in that I live in a heavily populated area where an accident would yield a slew of 911 calls to the police, I carry a cell phone all the time now, and I I have a 200 mile emergency towing plan in case of breakdown while OnStar threw away my 700 minutes for my phone that I paid for, discontinued all my hands free functions, and made all my mirror controls dark. Your rep seemed fairly new and inexperienced because there were several long moments of silence where I don’t think she knew what to say. As a 70+ year old retiree, I have no money to waste on services that are of no use to me. I had OnStar for 17 years and believed it to be a good feature but not so much any more. I asked your rep what the best price she could give me for the Safety and Security Plan with all the changes and she said agiain $249. I then told her to cancel my subscription. I get it that the loss of 2G was not the fault of OnStar but there was no discussion of upgrading my equipment and they did once before or if it was even possible. II sincerely resent the loss of my minutes without any notice. I used to leave the house on occasion and forget my phone but I felt I always had a back up. After all my concerns were expressed I asked when the changeover would totally take effect and she told me December31 2022. I seems that I went through all this aggravation and after my asking, I find out that I could have renewed my plan for one more year under the current conditions according to the advisor. I would have had to make a call to another department about the phone minutes. It seems that I could have been told that in the beginning. At that point I told her to just cancel my plan. In the past your customer service people were always able to come up with a solution to a problem, including price of services, particularly for long term members like me. That no longer seems to be the case. Your rep could barely go off script. Robert D. Campbell Former account # 010-5049-436\n",

      "I called 4 times. First time the woman told me I didn’t have a plan with Onstar so I had to either sign up monthly or pay out of pocket. If I paid out of pocket I would be paying anywhere from $150-$200 for the day. The second time I called the woman told me if I signed up for a monthly plan I couldn’t use my plan for the road side assistance that day and would also have to pay out of pocket on top of signing up. I found this strange. The third time I called I got hung up on without even talking to someone and the fourth time I called they told me I had a plan with Onstar and I was covered for the flat tire road side assistance. I think it’s terrible that I was told completely different things by different people and because of this I was on the side of the road for over two hours trying to figure out why multiple people were telling me I didn’t have a plan when in fact I did. The gentlemen who fixed my tire was excellent and the last person I talked to on the phone was great but other than that it was a headache trying to get help. I had to call my dad in hopes he would get there before roadside assistance did. It was a headache for him as well.\n",

That’s even After I has the trans flush thru the dealership I bought from. Other than that everything Is good with this truck.

      "The exact type of help I needed was lost in translation. I needed a tow truck to pull my car out 1st so that the spare could be removed from the lower rear section of my SUV. Secondly the person needed to know how to get the spare from under the vehicle. It took 3-4 calls before finally the right person arrived. Unfortunately he couldn’t get the cable to release the tire. He towed me to a nearby tire shop. The rim of the tire had a smaller slit & wouldn’t attach to the rim. I can’t say that the slit was caused by my vehicle being driven into the alley so the spare could be accessed. I can only attest to seeing the air initially coming from the threads when I called for help. I ended up having to buy an over priced tire. But at the end of it all I’m rolling again thanks to General Motors not giving up until they found me the help I needed. Thank you!\n",

My daughter took it to the family mechanic for the diagnostic reading to find out why it was stating that there is a something wrong with the probe module? Code PO420, and Code P305F. I call the dealer who tells me that this email with the codes will not work and they have to do a different one at over $100. This diagnostic, although the letter states Chevy and Onstar, isn't registering these codes in their systems nor did they get notification of an issue. What I want is the issue resolved. Are they responsible to honor the email of the report? Can a \"blow and go\" from a DUI affect the \"probe module?\" Is the module actually bad or is that device making it read that way?

We, the ones most needing the information, were cut off. My very stubborn husband, said if the information is there, just not accessible to us, he was going to get it.

I live in the San Francisco Bay Area where weather conditions or connectivity are rarely if ever an issue. When I'd call for directions I would deal with bad connections, poor audio, and when I finally did provide the information I'd have to call back because the directions failed to upload to my car. I never experienced these issues with any other outside connection from my car phone. It became so much quicker and easier to simply use the GPS on my cell phone. Despite these difficulties using your service, I do have to say that your call takers were consistently polite, helpful, and conducted business in a professional manner.

      "This was an incredibly frustrating ordeal. I wanted to change the credit card number on the OnStar account, combine the Colorado and Corvette accounts into one account and check to see what were the best accounts currently available. I called the OnStar 800 number from my office and spoke to “Sam” and explained to her what I wanted to do. She told me that I had to go out to my car and press the blue OnStar button from inside the car because what I wanted to do could not be done on the phone. So I went outside and sat in my car with the engine running for the next 45 minutes trying to get the above accomplished. I pressed the OnStar button in my Colorado and spoke with “Janice” and she was able to change the credit card to the new number for the account. However, she was not able to combine the two OnStar accounts into one and passed me on to another representative. After a a 5 minute wait “Janine” came on and was able to see the original account number from the Colorado but not the number on the Corvette. I told her that I canceled the Corvette account while it was in the dealership for six weeks getting a new transmission. She put both cars on the same account but could not help me with comparing available packages and transferred me to a specialist. After another 5 minute wait while I sat in the running car “Brittany” came on as a Loyalty specialist. She was very good and we spent a lot of time going over all of the available plans. We finally came up with a plan that will work for me and both cars. We put unlimited Wi-Fi on both the Colorado and the Corvette and a basic plan on the truck and a safety and security plan on the Corvette. She was very good at her job and I could tell that she enjoyed doing her job. Everything seemed set to go forward. Today…. I got a notice that OnStar billed me $37.44. That is the amount that I was billed for years on the Colorado. When I called OnStar today to find out why I was being billed from the old account instead of the charge for the new account, I spoke with “Mark”. He told me that the $37.44 was for this months charge for the Colorado. I explained to him that I just changed plans for the Colorado and Corvette. He told me that the new plan on the Colorado would start next month and that there was NO plan for the Corvette other than the Wi-Fi. I told him that if there was a new Wi-Fi then there had to be a new plan for the Vette. He said that there was no other plan. I told him that I spent 45 minutes sitting in my car with several representatives getting this changed and now he tells me that the Vette does not have a plan. I asked to talk to a manager and he told me that it would take 10 minutes before one was available. Ten minutes later he came back and told me no managers were available. I asked him to please have a supervisor call me. Right now everything seems like a complete waste of time.\n",

I called again and I was told that she couldn’t even find my current vehicle under my number or name, I had to explain to her that I have been on the phone with y’all twice already today so she said she would get me in contact with an agent. Once the agent got on the phone it went a lot smoother, he was able to find me a tow truck that could be there in 15 minutes, my car was picked up at 12:30. Then dealership my Tahoe was sent to didn’t even look at it that day. I am now stuck without my brand new Tahoe and two hours away from it.\n",

      "My break system completely went down on me as I was driving with my 3 infants. I was able to park it safely and call Cadillac roadside. It has took them over 24 hours to supposedly come and rescue. They experienced delays and did not bother informing me as a customer. I have placed several complains and still nothing has been done. Inner state towing is the worst company that can be used in case of any type of emergency. They still have not showed up . I had to cancel my service with them after waiting for the tow for 24 hours. Beeline towing did the actual pickup and they arrived within the hour. If my kids and I had waited- we would have been stranded in the middle of nowhere for a full day . They are extremely unprofessional and I would never reach out to them for any sort of business . They gave me the run around for days and never completed the job. So sorry that Cadillac has hired this company . They are absolutely useless .\n",

I was told there was o lay a month or year plan and if I didn’t purchase at that time then the discount might not be available.When the second young lady called me she was polite and u explained to her I was waiting till my pay date the 13th and going to buy a month plan because at this time I wasn’t able to afford a year plan. She said no problem let me see if I can help you, she offered the 3 month plan to me that not only shocked me but made me so happy and excited.

So when I go to log in to my account on the internet, enter my credentials, it shows me that my renewal is about $100 more (i.e. the normal price) than the offer I received. It's ridiculous...it should reflect the current email offer since the email is directed to me as a customer. Since I am a returning customer (5 years now) don't you think you should have the discounted offer automatically so we don't have to go over this year after year? And each year you want to sell me a \"Wifi data\" plan. Why not include it or some monthly wifi data minutes with my plan? You know like you do with the 30 minutes phone time included. You just make it more difficult than it has to be...or maybe that's the point.\n",

I was very nervous because I was far from home on the freeway.On Star was able to do a diagnostic test while I was in transit. Luckily it was something minor.I was so relieved.Another time I was on my way to a wedding,but my zip code did not match the address.The operator went out of her way to call the venue to make sure we had the correct place.I was very impressed on both occasions.I have tried to promote On Star to some friends,but they say why should they pay when you can get the service for free. Personally I don't mind paying because it's affordable and everyone I have ever been in contract with has always been pleasant.Another thing I forgot to mention,was I locked my keys in the trunk and On Star was able to unlock the doors from wherever you do it from.That kept me from having to wait for Triple A.That saved me time.All I can say is,I'm happy with On Star.I have always been terrible with directions.My friends and myself could tell you some really funny stories about how I got lost.Tank you OnStar.\n",

I live in fort Lauderdale but I always take my car back to the same dealership that I took it to or where I purchased it from shall I say. My disgust was knowing it would be there for a good while I had my data and my All-Star services placed on pause. What occurred was the lady who I was speaking to she canceled the service all together. When I called to have my services reinstated when I got my car back I was later told that all of my OnStar services which I had paid for were not reinstated and that the person that I spoke to literally put it on vacation mode or whatever that is. When I clicked the OnStar button it kept saying that all your services for OnStar and not active if you like to get the premium service please contact the sales people okay. For me that was trash I did not care to have the non premium services that I have been paying for. Also I was told that my alexa. That I was supposed to have received never came. I did have the same gentleman who reset my OnStar information he called me back. However the link that I was supposed to receive for my got never arrived and he needed to give it to me over the phone which I did not have the time to pull my car over again and take the link down. He stated he would leave it in the notes well upon recalling later that day OnStar to have everything we set I was told I'd have to pay another fee to get the premium services that I had for now so no I don't think I will be recommending on start to anyone because there are too many people too many variables and just a lot of crap the only thing I will say I'll keep is the data service because I need the Internet for my car. Overall that I am not happy with the service that I received after having it for what a month two months from May and still not receiving my echo dot still not receiving the link to be able to access Alexa and still not being able to do anything other than what I have now on the app and that's the GM OnStar app but thank you for nothing.\n",

      "I regret not using AAA to tow my vehicle to my dealership but as my 2021 Acadia is only a year old and I pay to lease it I thought I would rely upon GMC Roadside Assistance. This has been a debacle since I placed the first call yesterday. The customer service reps are fine. Kind and they attempt to be helpful but the various towing companies you contract with are wholly unreliable. We were ghosted yesterday. No one showed after 4 hours so I called and cancelled. A different company was scheduled for 8 a.m. this morning. They arrived 2.5 hours later with a flatbed truck and were unable to jumpstart my Acadia (which when I put in the request I had indicated I was unsure it would be able to start and shift to neutral) and as truck didn’t have a lift could not load my vehicle for transport. GMC promptly rescheduled yet a third towing service who was promised between 100-130 pm. They only just showed at 340 pm. They came with a flatbed truck despite the last service being unable to jump the vehicle. They offered to drag it (I declined fearing damage) but after more jumping tries they are now attempting to load onto truck. Fingers crossed everything goes smoothly from here on out. Thank God I was not stranded anywhere and that my truck was dead in my driveway. However, my work day (I am a healthcare worker) has needlessly been interrupted now two days in a row trying to coordinate this pick-up taking valuable time away from my duties so I will be working late yet another night. Second, my husband is at home awaiting a service arrival two days in a row when he is supposed to be sleeping as he works midnights. He is in law enforcement and needs to be alert for work tonight. Doubt he will be with all this back and forth. Also, For the first and second providers I was texted the phone numbers with names of the company by GMC. I was grateful for that and we tried to call them when they were late but each had phone numbers without voice service set-up AND there was no identifying info when I called to know whether or not I reached the correct towing company. Ugh! I am EXTREMELY disappointed with the unnecessary run around. On top of my Acadia having some strange electrical issue so I can’t drive it then this run around just to get it serviced I am so frustrated. I would have hoped for better from GMC given it is a company I have long trusted. That being said your employees in the call center were pleasant and helpful so no complaints there. It’s just incredibly concerning that one would have to wait so long for the various towing services suggesting their are systemic issues that need to be addressed.\n",

I was placed on hold several times as the representative seemed unaware of a program. Eventually spoke with a different representative who offered a lower price but it was more than I wished to pay so I cancelled the service. After some consideration, we felt we wanted to have the service so I called back. I told the representative I wished to reinstate and renew. I also mentioned the loyalty program but he said the previous quote was now unavailable. He asked if I or anyone was a veteran, first responder, etc. I advised I was a veteran. He also advised there was a Protection plan available (we previously had Safety & Security plan) that was the same except without navigation which is what I wanted and with discounts was at a satisfactory price. I renewed the service. I am disappointed with what you show on your website, ie just the top price, no discounts, no loyalty pricing, etc. Even some of your representatives don't present all that you have.

      "This new GMC Terrain customer with 23,012 miles on her SUV called Roadside Assistance due to an engine light notification issue. The engine light icon was static and stayed on while I was on the highway in Tallahassee, Florida. I turned the vehicle off and restarted it after a few minutes to see if the vehicle computer would reset. It did not. The engine light icon was still on. I continued to drive and pulled into a supermarket parking lot when the vehicle turned off, leaving me in the middle of one of the store's entrance. Not good. I called Roadside Assistance and immediately spoke with a very professional operator who asked me some questions and told me she would dispatch my report. She could not tell me what towing service would come. Said after my report was dispatched, someone would respond and let me know how long it would be until they could tow my car. This feedback was unsettling. Thank goodness my husband was with me. I was driving and he was the passenger. After NO RESPONSE within about 10 minutes, I started the vehicle. The engine light was still on, but I took a chance of getting home without assistance since it appeared nobody was coming to help me. At least not in a timely manner. I CANCELLED ASSISTANCE VIA INSTRUCTIONS AND RECEIVED A CONFIRMATION THAT ASSISTANCE WAS CANCELLED. At approximately 6:37 p.m. that night, I received a text message that a text message that I would receive a call in a few minutes regarding tow truck assistance!!! I called the number list on the text and a woman told me she could not find my assistance record. I told her I cancelled assistance about 2 hours earlier. She said sometimes AAA does not update them when a cancellation occurs so that may be why she could not find it. She kept looking for a report about the cancellation and finally saw it. I told her what happened and that I did not need a tow truck any longer. After hanging up with her, it was scary to think that had I not cancelled assistance that I may still be sitting out in a rural supermarket parking lot for 2 hours plus blocking one of their entrances. I was also frightening to think that if my husband was not with me, that I would be sitting there alone...and looking like a target for criminal actions for any sort. This does not reflect well about GM and its third-party services.\n",

This tow truck driver was the only person with any common sense throughout this whole situation. He was prompt, courteous and very helpful in getting to the tire shop instead of the dealership that was preferred (that did not have the equipment to service my vehicle).

I was told that for older vehicles such as my 2005 Buick Lesabre, it would be necessary to replace the entire Onstar hardware in my vehicle to be able to accommodate the new 5G format, or that a special plug in device could instead be installed to allow communication with Onstar. When I spoke with the representative yesterday, I was told that those options have been cancelled, and that I would have to download an app for the Onstar Guardian plan to a smartphone. I don't currently own a smart phone and have no need for one. Now either I'll have to buy one just to be able to access the Guardian plan, or do without the benefits of Onstar. I don't understand why G.M. decided to cancel the plan to update the hardware in my Buick. I understand that many G.M. vehicle owners of 2015 or older models have smart phones, but I am sure that there are many who do not and who do not wish to purchase a smart phone just to be able to continue with their Onstar service. My family and I have been owners of G.M. vehicles since 1981. This is no way to treat loyal G.M. customers.\n",

It was very scary and stressful, especially for my 85 year old mother in law who was in the car. It was a very disappointing asked frustrating service call.\n",

      "On Star is not what it used to be!! Too many services taken away that made me feel confident in knowing the company has been there to make me feel safe and secure. The weather reports, and road reports are no longer available and now hands free calling has been discontinued. I understand that ATT&T took the latter service away, but On Star should be able to find another carrier to replace them. Now I will lose my paid for minutes if I don't use them by the end of January 2022. Enough is enough!!! I told them to remove my credit card info from your system and bill me and that was not done. I noticed a monthly fee on my credit card. I called on that issue as I like to be informed of expiration and then pay the bill/account in full. I am totally discouraged in On Star services and I will be looking for an alternative to this company.\n",

      "With each additional update to the app, synchronization with my car's on board system gets slower and slower. Getting the app to boot beyond the buick log screen takes several minutes anymore. I get many \"unexpected server response\" errors. Diagnostics, remote start, take several minutes to execute if they do at all. I get many failures where the app isn't interfacing with the car. The app no longer retains the password so I have to keychain in just to get access which is inconvenient when trying to have quick access for remote start, maps, etc. I understand security but we're not talking nuclear codes here. You can lighten up the security requirements here. Maps and navigation tools are buried too deep in the app which makes it difficult to access while on the move. Those features should be front and center be it for me or the side seat driver that might be providing the Nav system inputs. Lastly, the holding down the button for locking the doors, remote start, etc. is ridiculous. That should just be one touch and done. I though the name of the game was convenience. If I had to hold down buttons, I could just go out to the car and press the ignition or door locks. I'm also not happy about the stripping down of the OnStar packages, namely the on star phone system where you got 30-60 minutes a month as part of the package. I drive in areas that still don't have good cellular coverage or if I'm without my phone, I could be in serious trouble.\n",

      "You did an absolutely horrendous job. I am ready to cancel my entire on star subscription and will be in touch to do so soon. On Sunday night August 1st my 17 year old daughter called me at 9:45pm about an hour and 20 minutes from my house. She had run over some debris on the road and punctured her front right tire. I told her to press the On Star button and call you for assistance. She spoke with someone at roadside assistance and they told her that a service provider would be there at 10:07-10:17 and provided her a contact number for the service provider. She was on a major roadway, so I stayed in touch with her closely. When the service provider did not show up she called them at 10:30 .. they said \"15 more minutes\" .. when they didn't show up then, she called back OnStar at approximately 11am. OnStar called the service provider who said they could no longer come help my daughter. OnStar told her they would contact the new provider, and they did, but they told her it would be 50 minutes. At this point, I left my house and started driving towards my daughter, as it didn't make sense for her to be all alone on this major road. She sent me a PIN of her location via my iPhone and I was able to find her without one missed turn. I arrived to her at approx 12:20am. The service provider was still not there, but at least I give the technician from this service provider credit because he continued to try and find her. The fact that On Star and his company could not help him boggles my mind. At 12:30 I sent my daughter home in the car that I drove to her, and I waited for the service provider. I was finally able to give him directions that helped him find me at shortly after 2am. I was very grateful that this driver stuck with looking for me and was able to put the spare time on my car and I was finally able to drive home and arrived at my house at 3:45am, 6 hours after my daughter first called On Star. Quite frankly, your performance was EMBARRASSING. Your technology should have helped the service provider get right to my car. I also spoke to an OnStar representative that indicated there would be an investigation done and I have heard nothing! 7 days later and not a word from you. I would like to hear from someone to hear what is being done about this. I am also planning to cancel my On Star service. Please tell me why I should not.\n",

      "I understand there is a sequence of questions that have to be asked. But the verbatim language used by the Call Center, is robotic and very impersonal. Once you have identified of who I am, there should be a few questions that can be skipped. Like…….. What color is my car. You have already identified me and my vehicle. Don’t ask. Just confirm. What is my mileage. If I tell you that I can’t get into my car. Then you should know I can’t read the odometer. Once I get in using the bypass screen, understand the vehicle. It is all digital. I can read it, if there is no power. Don’t ask me if I should be towed or if I need a jump. Connect me with a advisor and let them diagnose the problem. Please don’t patronize me by saying “I understand your frustration and Cadillac cars about your safety”. I know that you will fix it. That’s why I paid a 112K for the vehicle. Just say I’m working on getting it resolved as fast as I can. Don’t waste 5 minutes asking me questions that were already answered. I guess the moral of the story is have the agents be more fluid and just get the situation resolved. The tediousness of the call made more frustrated than having a dead battery.\n",

      "The lady I talked to did fine. I originally contacted OnStar back in June to cancel me service. I was on a special year plan and wanted to cancel before it flipped to $14.99 a month. You guys issued me a credit in June when that service was cancelled. But in July and August you guys charged me $14.99 for the limited remote access that I cancelled in June. You guys issued a credit for the August charge, but nothing for the July charge. I am not sure how this service was turned back on in July when I cancelled in June. I am out $14.99 for the July service I didn't even order. I will be watching my statements closer in the future. I can't communicate the level of frustration that the remote service is not included with the purchase of a new truck. When I got my 2017 in 2017 they told me it was included for 5 years. I traded it in on a new 2020 and then I find out that service is not included. I would think GM would be better a communicating when this level of service changes. I have bought 3 Silverado's in the past 4 years (2 brand new and 1 used).\n",

This last trip over Thanksgiving was the last straw. We did not have Wi-Fi for over half our trip. I called to cancel my internet plan that I've had since 2018. Not only did I on several occasions lose my internet service not one time that I had called I was offered any type of discount. The only thing I get is that they've reset my internet after I've spent 30 minutes on OnStar pulled alongside a road with my 11-year-old son that has Autism. After I canceled they sent me two emails saying how they've rectified the situation and thanks for being a customer. I canceled because I'm not obviously a valid customer. I would have been more satisfied with a free month or a discount not a copy and paste generic email.\n",

I talked to OnStar. I don’t care that there’s a fee, but don’t charge me without explaining why. I was told there would be fees after the initial trial, but not during. Why would I want to pay OnStar for unlimited data when I already have it on my phone? Why would I need to speak with 3 different people to cancel my trial? Why would your rep try to explain to me how the conversation took place when I was one of two people actually in the conversation and he wasn’t? I feel this was a sneaky, underhanded business practice and I refuse to do business with your company. You can take that little blue button and shove it straight up your asses.

After 2:37 am I was told someone would come out to my location.... Which no one ever showed up.

      "A few days before 8/6 I called OnStar after I received an email telling me my 2011 Buick Regal would not support the in-vehicle service beginning in December. I could purchase the service via the app and if I purchased that service before a certain date I would get a discounted rate. I decided I didn't want the app service so when I called I told them I just wanted to end my service in December. I was told in order to do that I would have to wait until December and call back then. Okay, I will call back then. The rep tried to sell me a discounted rate for the service I presently had if I didn't cancel in December. I informed him that was not a discounted rate since that was what I was paying now. I told him no and I would call back in December to cancel. A few days later I received an email from OnStar thanking me for my purchase and a charge on my credit card for $9.61. I didn't purchase anything! Then the credit card company emailed me to say the charge from OnStar was suspicious and it was reoccurring! That's when I called OnStar back on 8/6 to find out what was going on. The first person I spoke with told me that the rate l presently had was a promotional one and the $9.61 was added to my rate of $14.90($13.99+tax) to reflect the new rate. I told them that when I renewed my OnStar service back in April I was told that the rate of $13.99+ tax was good until my car would no longer support the in-vehicle service which now, according to them, was December. I decided right then to cancel that day. They connected me to another agent who said the $9.61 would be credited to my account, the service would be cancelled that day, and there would be another $1.45 credit on the account. I am extremely disappointed with how the person I spoke with on my first call handled this situation. I have had the OnStar service since l first purchased this car back in October of 2011. I paid my subscription up front on a yearly basis.

After several failed attempts I informed an agent that I had contacted several agents already and the downloads were unsuccessful. That agent was oblivious to the likelihood that my system wasn’t compatible any longer. The agent connected me with a technician to troubleshoot the problem. The tech told me that it would take several minutes to do the diagnostics and she would telephone me. I never received a call back.

      "I've had OnStar since 2013, and I feel there has been a marked deterioration in the quality of your service in the past 2-3 years: Essentially, when I am seeking directions, the OnStar agents often don't seem as professional as I originally remember them being. More specifically, — 1) They often don't speak up as loudly or clearly as they once did, sometimes speaking too quickly as well, often sounding \"distant,\" as if they may be on \"speaker phone,\" which makes it difficult for me to hear or understand what they are saying. They need to speak directly, loudly, and distinctly into the microphone they are using! No mumbling, please! 2) They sometimes don't seem as kind, patient, or solicitous (in seeking to fully please/satisfy \"the customer\"—me) as they once did in their interactions with me. On occasion they simply hang up without even first making sure that I have in fact received the instructions they have sent to me or checking to see if I have any other questions. Simple courtesy would require that they do these things without just disconnecting from me rather immediately once they've sent the instructions. I must admit, these kinds of incidents make me wonder if these agents are no longer being properly trained in carrying out these basic job responsibilities. Or perhaps you are no longer hiring the same caliber of people as you once did? Just a couple of other things: Sometimes I have to wait longer for traveling directions/instructions than I used to. Have you hired fewer agents, or what would be the reason for longer wait-times? The sound transmission quality doesn't seem as good as it originally was. Again, are agents allowed to use speaker phone (they shouldn't do so!), or is there some budget cuts you've made in your system, such that sound transmission quality has suffered? You no longer offer any kind of weather report; why is that? Thus I am still paying the same amount (or more) for the service I am receiving, but I am not getting the same benefits I once did, in more ways than one (see everything listed above). Although I was originally (back in 2013) very impressed with On-Star, due to the overall change in quality/service, I am seriously re-considering whether On-Star is worth its price these days. I could just use the Google Map app on my phone instead, but I do like the hands-free aspect On-Star offers. Still, there is room for much improvement these days. I wouldn't say this (or be able to say this) if I hadn't experienced a better quality of On-Star service when I first enrolled in your program back in 2013. Please ask yourselves, what has changed—in what you're doing and offering—over the past eight years? I offer these points as constructive criticism; I hope you will give them the thoughtful attention they deserve. And I'm hoping I'll eventually begin to see a return of the \"old\" On-Star I originally appreciated so very much. Finally, thanks for giving me the opportunity to offer some feedback. I've been wanting to do so for awhile now, but was unsure how to go about the process.\n",

Instead, a local towing company rushed to help me, free of charge, as they do for anyone with a child or pet locked in a vehicle.

      "Our vehicle that broke down is a new 2022 GMC Yukon Denali, 10,500 miles on Sunday Aug. 28, 2022 in Tyngsboro, MA. The tow company arrived quickly, the driver was very good. We traveled with him to our purchasing dealer 28.3 miles away. We confirmed with GM Roadside Assistance that the distance was approved since it is a new vehicle. Mid way to the dealership, the tow company owner called and said we had to pay a $60 mileage charge or our vehicle would be unloaded at the next highway exit. The owner said Allstate did not approve the trip. We paid the $60 but felt like we held hostages. The appointment number is 135145012 Lake County Tow Northeast Division. I have tried to get in touch with Allstate, no success. GM Roadside Assistance felt the claim was paid, yet we’re out $60. Please help reimburse us.

      "My experience at 3:30 p.m. when I called OnStar back with Gabe and Mylene was much better than my first call between 11:42 a.m. to 12:02 p.m. I was told at 12:02 p.m. that a manager would call back as soon as they were free; no one ever called me back. I then decided to call back at 3:30 p.m. because it does not take 3 and 1/2 hours for a manager to become free and return a call. I then called again on 12/2 because on 11/30 at 3:30 p.m. I had been told that I could use my remaining minutes through 12/2. At 9:12 p.m. on 12/2 my minutes were deleted. I called OnStar to have them replaced so I could continue to make calls to use my minutes. I spoke to Alex (female) and her boss was to get on the line. All of a sudden, I was told that OnStar was experiencing telephone problems and her boss (Mariam) never got on the line, but she was going to call me back. Of course, Mariam never bothered to call me back. Not calling back happened twice (11/30 and 12/2) and clearly is now how OnStar operates now. OnStar is no longer the honest legitimate organization it used to be 17 years ago in 2004 when I joined. You have employees and managers that are completely dishonest answering your phones and are not trying to help your loyal customers. Loyalty from customers like me is being met by dishonesty and lying.\n",

      "The tow truck technician was very unprofessional, commenting on how pretty I was and wanting to know if I would be interested in getting with a black guy. He also kept trying to hang on to my key fob, I understand that he needed it for a time to load my vehicle, but I had to keep asking for it back as he kept putting it in his pants pocket, even upon unloading my vehicle, he also had to keep adjusting the chains as my vehicle would come off of the bars when turning or backing up. When arriving at the dealership, the service lady came out to speak with me and the tow truck guy was commenting to me about how he would like to get with her, that she too was something hot, I felt very awkward and was very concerned about my safety. If he would openly talk to me the way he did, what would he do if he had an opportunity with no one around? I am very concerned that he now knows where I live! After commenting on nice stuff we have on our farm, that's why I am very concerned. Plus I don't understand why it takes hours to get help\n",

I was told to get the three free months of your programs i had to give a credit card number. I told your associate i did not want any more than the three free months. I was told I have to contact you to cancel it after the three months. i told them i will not contact them to cancel something i will not and did not authorize. The associate said I would be notified when the three months gets close and i could cancel it at that time. I was never notified of the three month ending date. On 11-18-21 I found out my credit card was charged for the month of October. When I contacted onstar there was an additional charge for November. I was told by the associate that there would be a refund to my account in 5 to 7 business days. This is not how to do business if you want people to ever try your programs and continue to use them.\n",

      "In the past, If I decided I was ready to go with a particular OnStar related service, I'd at least still be able to use the OnStar Mobile App to perform simple yet essential functions like starting my vehicle remotely, locking my vehicle if I couldn't remember if I had done so or unlocking it if I locked my keys in the car. The ability to do these things, provided convenience not to mention piece of mind that a car owner wants to have in the type of world we live in today. Now OnStar wants to charge a minimum of $14.00 per month, for a service that includes features that quite frankly should still be available exclusive of any cost driven monthly package. The above mentioned, were some of the reasons I continue to support OnStar and the Chevy brand. I've been driving Chevrolets since my first purchase of the Equinox in 2007 and I'm sure I'm not the only person that feels this way about the change. As a result, I may begin to look into other vehicle brands as I don't feel that a customer’s piece of mind and loyalty to a brand should be dismissed in light of a company’s policy change to make even more money than they're already making in a so called 'security or essentials package'. Right now, other than scheduling service appointments, the app is useless to me. Recognizing the time, I’ve taken to respond to your survey OnStar, I hope that there is serious consideration in changing this policy going forward. Thank you.\n",

      "I asked for directions to go to a location and I was not sure how to get here. I knew that it was less than a hour away. The person who scheduled the route said that it was 3 1/2 hours away. I don't know where she was taking me to but I knew it was not right. I was looking for a business in Normal, Illinois and I was in Peoria, Illinois. I assumed that it was 30 to 40 minutes away depending on traffic and road construction. I had to call back several times to connect with a person I could take to who would give me corrections. After I got the correct directions, I was fine. With all the road construction and changing interstate roads, it is nice to have directions to the right road. It seemed to be a misunderstanding. I had this happen once before. I was going home from Kentucky. I was directed to Decatur, Indiana in stead of Decatur, Illinois. I said I was going Decatur, Illinois and apparently a misunderstanding. I now say \"I need directions home\", but in this case I was not going directly home.\n",

Now you've changed your \"service\" so that besides paying for onstar, your customers must also pay for another service--the right kind of phone--in order to be able to use YOUR service!

I will NEVER recommend OnStar to anyone--and I wish I hadn't in the past! And even for customers WITH a smart phone, what happens if they’re “out in the woods camping” and they’re attacked by someone—they manage to get away, get in their car and drive away—but their phone is still in their tent! THEY can’t use your “service” to get help either! But I bet it will be their fault—that they didn’t think to grab their phone—while being attacked! Useless in REAL emergencies! Goodbye!

Finally at 3:30am Monday morning I purchased a membership with AAA and they finally came. I called Monday morning around 11am and asked to speak to a supervisor and was told no. I’m getting a lawyer. I was left in the hot Sun with my dog all night, all the next day and then the following night. I have an injury to my leg and can barely walk. OnStar was made aware of this. I ended up urinating on myself and the seats in my car. I know the calls are recorded and will be requesting them. I was laughed at as I was crying, no sobbing, and begging for help. I was hung up on multiple times and at one point even told when I phoned back “Now try not to get disconnected this time Ms. Christensen.” Let me repeat, I’m contacting an attorney.\n",

      "The tow service provider took my vehicle and they did not make mention of any additional fees/charges. I spoke with this provider directly and they did not make mention of the possibility of any additional charges, either. However, once the driver arrived at the destination, the provider called stating I owed them an additional 85 dollars and that they would not release my vehicle AND that I only had a few minutes to call OnStar to rectify the issue. I told them they could not take my car hostage and to just return my vehicle back to me and I was told I would be charged even more money. I was very upset behind this, because I explicitly asked OnStar we're there any fees and I was told my plan included the services I needed. Since I was not in my vehicle to call OnStar to handle this issue, I had to look up a number and the prompts \"sent me around the world and back\" just to connect with someone. Imagine the unrest I had after the provider told me I only had a few minutes. Frankly if he had an issue with payment, he should have called the company he's contracted with...which is not me! He put pressure on me after taking possession of my 55K+ vehicle. After that experience I am considering to cancel these services. I have already told OnStar to never send that provider to my aid again. They service is horrible. Furthermore they were due to my house between 2:50 and 3:10PM. They did not arrive to well after 4PM and I had to initiate the call to understand was there a delay or not and how long it would be. Poor customer service all the way around....and clearly they had a way to contact me, because they surely wanted $85 from me immediately. Not problem initiating a call then. Lastly, whoever called me stated to me what my plan included. I explained this was incorrect and this person essentially was pressed with trying to correct me about a plan I AM paying for. Again poor customer service.\n",

      "First thing I called for directions and was disconnected between I am sending you the directions and receiving the directions. I blamed that on inexperience. Later I called and the operator had what sounded like toddlers that she was dealing with. My call was disconnected while I was spelling the name of the town my desired location was in. When I signed up with onstar I am almost positive I was told $31+ a month, but when I called to cancel due to frustration with poorly attentive response, I was told that $39+ had been taken from my account only a few days earlier. Then I was told my “prorated” refund would be $8. Even at a week earlier that would be 25% not 80% that I should have been financially responsible for. Did you catch the part where they took $39+ from my account? This raise onstar gave themselves was done without my knowledge or consent, and should be illegal. If I contracted a job with onstar or one of its employees for $3,000 and when received the check changed the amount to $4,000 I bet it would be illegal? How onstar can do this is beyond me but it makes you a corporation I want nothing to do with nor would I recommend to any one who is not an enemy. This is nothing to mention when my truck broke down 3 blocks from the projects in north St. Louis Missouri it took 3 hours to get roadside assistance. That after expressing security issues for thousands of $$ in tools exposed in my truck bed. I only got service when I asked for the number of the second effort on your part. I called them and said if they were there in 20 minutes I would pay them $50 in addition to your contracted amount. They were there 15 mins later and told me they used to have their garage in the area but moved due to breaking and that I was right to feel insecure because when dark hit the criminals would be coming around. This is the security provided by onstar.\n",

Which it did arrive safe and sound to the repair location after finally showing up so late .the last wrecker service was not the one to pick up the vehicle.

I used OnStar and XM services for most of those years in most of these vehicles. In 2018 I purchased a newer but used Chevrolet pick up and asked my OnStar account be transferred. I was informed I could no longer have the same plan, but through much discussion and several calls, my minutes that I had paid for were transferred to my new vehicle. I was told if I purchased a minimum amount of minutes each year I could continue using my rollover minutes until they were used. I had about 7000 or 8000 minutes that were transferred from my old vehicle. I did not use my OnStar too much and without notice or warning my time to purchase expired last month. I was \"given\" 300 minutes when I called. I am not real happy about losing my thousands of minutes in this manner. Due to covid, I have not been travelling in the last couple of years.

      "As an ONSTAR subscriber for nearly 20 years, I have always called to renegotiate my rate for a 6 or 12 month subscription for my car (Cadillac). My call on October 27, 2021, was to negotiate a renewal for my husband’s GMC Terrain. I told the representative that I was seeking the very best rate, as a longtime subscriber, for his 2020 Terrain. If she came back once, she came back 6 times with different rates, putting me on hold for many times while she repeatedly checked to see if she could offer me a better rate! She could see what we’d been paying. I told her if she could match it or come very close to what he’d had, I’d consider renewing his contract. Otherwise, I’d be cancelling his service in this “extra” car. Our current subscription was a 6 month + 1 free for a total of $80.22. She continued to give me prices ranging from $17 to $20 a month!!! Was she not hearing what I was saying. I was put on hold a ridiculous number of times, and then she’d quote an even higher fee with maybe a month free. One time she said she’d honor my previous price with 3 months free!! I knew this couldn’t have been right. I eventually asked for customer service/manager. She transferred me to the loyalty department, and a gentleman there tried to assist me. After my explaining the simple request I had almost an hour ago, he, too, quoted different rates, one as high as $23, a month!! He knew the previous rate of $80.22 for 6 + 1 free, yet he continued to give me much higher prices. After 1 1/2 total hours on the phone, feeling very frustrated and upset, I cancelled ONSTAR on our second car, the 2020 Terrain. I was mad at myself for hanging onto the phone that long! Neither representative was efficient in customer service. Simply tell me that the previous rate no longer exists, and this is the best rate we currently have……. Just absurd. A very disappointing and frustrating experience I hope never to have again. Don’t keep quoting varying and higher rates after the customer tells you what they are able to pay! I think it’s terrible that people have to negotiate rates anyway. Seniors on a fixed income are taken advantage of by automatic renewals at a rate ONSTAR sets for them. In both of our cars, we’ve only ever used the turn by turn directions. With iPhone, Google maps, navigation features available now, I’d think ONSTAR would better serve their loyal customers by making their fees more affordable in order to keep these longtime customers. They have lost one vehicle of ours, and if I go through a similar fiasco when it’s time to renegotiate my car’s ONSTAR Safety and Security package, they will lose another longtime customer. Not the same caliber of customer service as in the past. Also find we are waiting longer while in our car for a representative to answer the call for directions. One man recently was actually rude to us when he couldn’t get the address right. Language barrier? Blamed me for not saying it correctly! Sad to see a company like this fail to maintain their reputation, in our experiences.\n",

      "I’m trying not be overly critical; to be fair this started with OnStar and most or all of the issues were on their side. I had a flat tire, as I told the person helping me, it was the drivers side front tire. I am pulled to the side of the road on an overpass, also something I informed the caller of. The first person they sent out was in a Prius. Now if a drivers side tire of a car pulled over to the side of the road needs to be changed, the person changing it is going to be in a lane of traffic and the vehicle sent needs to have flashing lights and the ability to block the lane so the tire change can be done safely. The guy in the Prius couldn’t change the tire and said he wasn’t allowed to as it was dangerous. I called back to request a tow truck come so they could block the lane and safely change the tire. I’m capable of changing my own tire but this situation was dangerous (the reason I called for assistance). I called again and they sent another service. While waiting for the second guy who was late, all I could imagine is after sitting there for 2 hours, this guy too was going to say he couldn’t do it. So I walked to the nearest gas station, got a can of fix a flat, walked back to my vehicle and used the fix a flat. That got me enough air to make it to said gas station in my vehicle. At this point the 2nd guy shows up (he was 15 minutes late when I decided to walk to get the fix a flat). He changes the tire at the gas station. All in all it left me and my wife with the realization that we need triple a. These other roadside assistance services aren’t quite as good.\n",

I then got a phone call which may have already been coming to let me know they were diagnosing my problem. Everyone was very kind and as informative as possible.

      "I tried to update my service package from the free trial I was receiving to connected services package. I was told because my truck has a heated steering wheel issue (chip not available when truck was ordered) I could not get the connected services package. Representative tried to get an explanation as to why a chip shortage affected my service I requested, he got no explanation. Then I was offered the premium on star package at a 30% discount. The problem I have with all this is that package has the features I wanted in the connected services package that I couldn’t get. So even at a 30% discount the premium package is still $15.00 more a month than what I wanted in the connected package. Unless someone can tell me why I couldn’t get the package I wanted , I feel like I got strong armed into getting a more expensive premium package that I didn’t want. I chose to go with the premium because I don’t want to have a brand new vehicle with all these features and not be able to use them. But I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT!!! Representative John was extremely patient and helpful in trying to get some of my questions answered. My thanks and appreciation to him.\n",

      "My attempt to get assistance recently from an OnStar Advisor occured when my car started making weird noises (apparently from one of my back tires). I wanted a diagnotics test run on my car and a tire pressure check to make sure I wasn't getting a flat tire. I am a 78-yr old widow and was driving alone. The OnStar Advisor told me she would put me on a brief hold and handle my request. She said not to hang up; she would get back on the line shortly. I waited for awhile, but she never returned back to the line. When I was initially talking to her, I could heard a lot of noise in the background. That was a little distracting, but I understand that people are having to work from their homes these days. (I mention it merely because this situation has occured several times before with my OnStar calls since the pandemic. I often hear children in the background, background noises, conversations, doors opening and closing, dogs barking in the background, etc.) This is not a complaint --I understand we are all living in a different situaton right now. I am just making this comment because it can be distracting to someone driving their car and talking to OnStar trying to get some assistance. So, after continuing to wait on this OnStar call, I heard a hang-up sound and the line went completely dead. My OnStar call had been disconnected. In case this was accidential, I waited for a callback from her. She never called me back and I did not get tthe assistance I had requested. However, sometime later, I attempted to get OnStar asisistance again. I was still having car issues. I then told a different Advisor what happened. She quickly took care of my request and provided the assistance that I needed. So, everything turned out okay on my second call. I have had my Onstar service since 2014 and it is very valuable to me. Your service advisors are usually very helpful, courteous, professional and understanding. Thank you\n",

      "This response is not to be published in any manner nor am I to be identified for any purpose other than my private review of On-Star for this customer service survey.Let me start by saying before this call I have never had a problem with On-Star or it’s representatives. Highly recommended it to everyone and when purchasing a vehicle in the future would really would have considered another Chevy/GM vehicle because of On-Star. I was asking questions about the email I received stating my on-star would be changing. It was very unclear how it would affect costs for using the service, if it would work in my car etc. The biggest problem is the “upgrade” could also disable all the On-Star buttons in my car. The solution presented for what seemed to be an inconvenience for me was utilizing the new app that I would install on my phone. We are in a hands free State and during an emergency it is not always possible to reach or activate ones phone. The agent could not tell me if I would be charged per minute basis for using On-Star with the new gadget or if using phone app. Could not tell me how turn by turn navigation would be completed. Will it still show up on my information screen or have to be viewed on the small screen of my phone. And honestly if I need an app on my phone to do all of this with possible extra charges why do I need On-Star?\n",

      "The first time I called I wanted to talk to billing so I was put on hold for a long time and then I got dropped. Then I had to press the button a second time and another advisory came on, so I asked to be transferred again. This time the wait wasn't as long as before, and then the nicest most pacient advisor answered. I forgot his name, but he's the one that kindly processed my wife's refund and got me all squared away with my new plan. Please give him a pat on the back, as he was very, very thorough and pacient. I'm so glad I got this survey, since I didn't know how to go about congratulating him. Thanks and please keep him as part of your staff for a long long time! He made up for the fact that I got dropped and then had to start all over again. I'd also like to thank OnStar for the prompt refund on my wife's account for a service that was no longer needed.\n",

      "OnStar services and communications with clients SUCK. I have Remote Access, Phone Service and Diagnostic services from OnStar. Each has a different expiration. The services should have concurrent expirations and the expiration date should be a fixed date vs. the day the service is renewed. For example, I have proactively renewed services in the past a few days prior to the contract expiration and the new expiration is based upon the renewal date vs. the expiration date (customer is not compensated for the early days' prior to the last expiration). OnStar provided no communication/reminder regarding an expiring service. Failure to renew the Diagnostic service resulted in the deactivation of ALL of my other services. Why would Diagnostic Services drag Remote Access and Phone Service down when said service expires? Without satisfactory notification from OnStar, I could have been locked out of my vehicle when I expected to have Remote Access service? My account was inadvertently deactivated by OnStar about a year ago. I discovered this fact when I attempted to use the Phone Service for the first time and was advised my account had been deactivated. OnStar rendered no communication regarding the deactivation. It took 2 days for OnStar to research the issue and reactivate my account. The operator on the phone could not help me. He instructed me to contact OnStar via by vehicle. OnStar services are extremely expensive and the service is crappy. My vehicle already provides me with most diagnostic elements at no cost. My cell phone provides map/driving instructions. My use of the 3 services I have paid for is nominal. The incremental cost to access the OnStar technology has to be very small yet the cost is exorbitant. I discussed these issues with the owner of a GM vehicle and his opinion of the OnStar services overall mirrors that on my experience. There appears to be little compelling rationale for me to continue my patronage of OnStar. I certainly would not recommend OnStar service to anybody.\n",

      "You have the recording, probably with 3/4 different people. I was asked about my problem, I answered. I remember being asked about a spare. I informed them that my 2016 Malibu DID NOT come with a spare, only a air pump. My tire was on flat. They told me by me not having a spare they could not change the tire. Nothing really they could do but have me towed to a dealership. Soooo I'm 2 hours away from home....it's Sunday. No dealership is open on a Sunday. I told them to send the tow service. That was maybe after 12pm. I got more help from a stranger than anyone else. The service they called to assist me contacted me 2 hours later....2 hours later.....I got no assistance from a service I pay monthly for. Someone else had to help me and my daughter get home because I was 151 miles too far to help. Yes your representative informed me how far I was away from home and they did not cover helping me since it's a Sunday.. I think more thought should of came when packaging cars without a spare for cost control. Also, never used the machine in the trunk of my car , yet it had leaked white liquid from a hose. I just don't understand. I was more out of pocket dealing with this than my whole vacation. You've lost a customer with this feature/policy. I do not feel safe\n",

      "THIS IS A VERY RARE CADILLAC BUILD 1 of 1 GENERAL MOTORS HAND BUILT I AM TRYING TO OBTAIN ALL HISTORY FROM LANSING CADILLAC PLANT. NO SUCCESS LANSING CADILLAC IGNORANT -----Original Message----- From: CustomerCare@Cadillac.com To: mikemcguinty@aol.com Sent: Tue, Jan 28, 2020 8:42 pm Subject: RE: US_CADILLAC_EN Owner Question Dear Mr. McGuinty, Thank you for contacting Cadillac Customer Care and for being a member of the Cadillac family. We appreciate the time you have taken to write us with regards to your 2018 Cadillac Escalade. Yes, I am able to verify the information that your previously provided about the sales of the vehicle, previous owner and mileage (2,860). The VIN with the 000009 is not in our database. I checked all VIN’s ending to 000020 trying to find some additional clues. I can supply the facts, but there is not a way that I know of to find where the vehicle was for its first 2,890 miles or if it was the first resale production. I have seen many unique VIN order types; executive vehicles, special events, ride & drive, the V series used for the racing school and they all have a VIN that I can see all their information. This is intriguing: The original information on the order is incomplete. Normally I see “Invoicing Service Agent” (This is blank), the “Ship to Information” (See below) and “Delivery Information” (This is blank). The blanks would normally show a dealer or it would show our parking lot where GM executive cars are delivered to down on 11 Mile Rd. I tried to find the original vehicle invoice and it does not pull up in the dealer invoice system. Still researching, so I pulled up a VIN that shows the 11 Mile Rd delivery address Order Type 81 and the invoice is not available too. Order Type: 81 (CVMS USE) - This could be a special event or a GM executive vehicle. The original order was not placed by a dealer. Ship to Information PENSKE VEHICLE SERVICES 1225 E MAPLE RDAD TROY MI 48083-2818 One more check on the vehicle build sheet compared to another Model: 6DP69-2010 CTS 3.6L SIDI RWD. This option does not appear on the other vehicle build. OAR - PRE-PRODUCTION PROCESSING OPT. I have attached for your reference. Sequential VIN numbers, 000001 or 000002 are for specialty vehicles only. The serial or last six are normally randomly generated. The other build sheet that I provided with the last six, 132534, is not the 132,534th CTS built that year, because there was not that many produced. So to have the 000012 is special as it was not a randomly built vehicle. My suggestion is to ask your service advisor to show you delivery information under – View Vehicle Delivery Information. This is located in the system that they check the warranty information. I decided to attach the information to the bottom of the vehicle build. Then look up the services that this Penske shop performs. Perhaps they may have records. I spent 3.5 hours researching (including 5 minutes with colleagues discussing wagons) in a multitude of databases. I read your comments in a Cadillac forum too. This is the only information that I can add that you did not previously state that you had. I would like to offer you a $100 service voucher to cover the cost of your next oil change, tire rotation or other service. For your reference, the Service Request number assigned to your case is [9-5781938414]. Please refer to this number on any future correspondence about your case.

      "I left the car in Drive and locked it, thinking I had turned it off. Next morning the car was a dead brick. I couldn't call OnStar from the car, because there was not power. I called Felix Chevrolet. They gave me a number to call related to my car's warranty (it was the OnStar #, but they didn't tell me that). I then looked up OnStar on my Chevy app and contacted them that way (had never used this feature before). That worked and someone was on the way. They arrived early than estimated which was good. The App gave the wrong address to the operator, so they had to call me several times to figure out that I was... at my home. The mechanic showed up in an unmarked white pickup truck. A little suspicious. I had no way of knowing who he was or if he was associated with Chevy or OnStar. Seemed very low-budget. There should definitely be a chevy logo on the side of his truck. He finally figured out how to open the hood, but did not know this going in, and he figured out where the battery connections were, but did not know that already; which is to say he doesn't already know his way around a Chevy Volt. Also, he had no idea what was going on. The car started up, but it's a plug in hybrid and it was silent. He unplugged the jumper box and the car went dead again. So he jumped it again. But again it's very confusing, because there was power in the propulsion batteries, but the 12v was dead; so why wasn't it starting on it's own??? Why don't the propulsion batteries keep the 12v charged? He didn't know enough about the system to know what the next steps were, or if the car was good to go at this point. That's my major complaint. He couldn't tell me what to do next. The Check Engine light was on, and he could not explain to me why. I put the car into hold mode to run the engine, but you have to drive it around to run the engine. I called OnStar for a diagnostic, and was told that all kinds of elements of the car were not functioning properly, but I had 7 days to get the car to a garage. So I risked it and drove the car in Hold mode, running the engine the whole time, with the Check Engine light on to Felix Chevrolet in LA. Once there, the mechanic poked his head into the drivers side window of the car and... the check engine light went off. So basically, it just took that long for the 12v to get enough of a charge from the engine for the car to be working properly? And all those alerts over at OnStar were wrong?? I'm very glad we got it all working again, but I still would like to know how the 12v works in relations to the Propulsion Batteries. Is the engine the only element that keeps the 12v charged? If the 12v needs to have a charge to tun on the car, what keeps it charged?? If the 12v does not need to be charged to turn on the car (there was power in the Lithium Ion Propulsion batteries), why was my car dead?\n",

      "The customer service rep was fine he did a good job explaining the changes ON STAR is making due to the G3 changing to G 4 or G5 its the changes i don't like, for example you now have to have to down load an app and when completed sensor well be on your phone because the sensors on my car go off as of Jan1st 2023..Not for nothing but what if you forget you phone at home and you in an accident your out of luck. So how do emergency services get to you? I don't like the fact you no longer talk to a person when you press your On Star button , you can't send a check and pay in full i am on a fixed income the151 a year i can afford now its more and you are billed monthly billed monthly . I'm not happy you well be losing a customer after July 17th. If its not broke don't try to fix it, You guys made change not for the better to me at this point your changes are more trouble than its worth. I loved On Star now not so much you make me feel unsafe with the changes you have made.. This new plan using the cell phone i think you can do better than that a lot better i know you can!\n",

      "First time calling in and being transferred I was hung up on. I had to call back in. The young lady I talked to on the second call was very nice. Her name is Sheila. She canceled my service which is what I wanted. I am very disappointed with OnStar and yes technology advances, you should have figured out a better solution for people that have older cars. You all knew this would be a possibility. Attaching it to a smartphone is a crappy solution. Smartphones are not always an option because not only may you not be able to reach your phone but you may not be in the right mind to operate your phone in case of an emergency. Because of this I will probably not be the only OnStar customer to cancel my service and that is sad because OnStar is a great product that gives my daughter peace of mind when I am out driving on my own.

      "I pressed the OnStar button to ask a question about minutes for talk time. While on that call,I was offered to renew my plan on a special rate of $139.93 for paying early. When I looked at my plan online it had a different name. I had been switched to the Protection plan. I then made a call on this date to make sure that I was on the essential plan. I was told during this phone call that I could be offered the essentials plan for $223.94. I had already paid $139.93 to renew. I paid to renew and not to get my plan changed. That is not what I was offered. I was told that if I paid the remaining difference from both of those, I would be given 3 month complimentary months of Onstar. I would have 15 months instead of 12 months. I told them No.I told them I wanted the 3 months complimentary out of my 12 month plan. It had been a mistake done on your side not mine. I told them I was willing to pay a total of $167.94 for the 12 months. Which meant me paying an additional $28.03, even though I had been offered to renew for $139.93.I would pay for the 9 months @$18.66 and 3 would be complimentary. I never asked to get switched from my essential plan. I was on this second phone call for about an hour. Nothing was accomplished. I asked to get the number to call a supervisor. They said there wasn’t a number I could be given. I’m very dissatisfied with this service. I have been a loyal customer that pays on time. I hardly use your service. I feel very dissatisfied on how you treat your customers. After this month plan expires on October. I have cancelled any renewal plan.\n",

      "The person who initially answered was a bit rude. He did not tell me his name nor did he say, “Hello, Onstar, how may I help you today?”All I heard was “yes”. I told him I wanted to buy some minutes. He asked for my name and phone number. As I was starting to give him my cell phone number, I stopped and asked if he wanted the onstar car phone number, as I wasn’t sure what phone number he wanted. He very abruptly said “No I can see the number your calling from, I don’t need that number, I need your phone number on your account to verify who you are.” Those weren’t the exact words, but very close. It was his tone more than anything. It was like I was inconveniencing him by asking him a stupid question. Not the friendly professionalism I’ve come to expect from an Onstar representative. By contrast, the woman who he transferred me too was very friendly and professional. She told me her name asked how she could help me and got me the minutes that I wanted. So I rated the call only a five. She was at 10, but the other guy was a 1.\n",

      "The first person told me I had to wait for some tow company working in NY and it was estimated 4-4.5 hr wait. Then I contacted back asking if a local company can be used so I wouldn’t be stranded for hours and reimbursed by Chevy and was told probably not and they will try to get me help. Still waiting I sent photos of local companies and asked again for a local to help me instead of hours waiting. Finally a sweet professional woman cancelled the out of state tow Company. She got me help closer so I wouldn’t be stranded all hours of the night. She even called to make sure I was home safe. I was very upset that my newer Chevy was a form of transportation meant to keep me safe traveling by myself and I was stranded. The vehicle still isn’t working but service isn’t available until Monday morning when that department is open. I was upset and sorry I forgot her name. She was the only one that worried about my well being and safety and she went above and beyond when the other employees failed me.\n",

Being so far away, I was worried I wasn’t going to be able to find someone nice and caring enough to not rush her through the process. He did just the opposite. He took time out of his day, to put my mind at ease and get her taken care of. I will be forever grateful for what he did to help her. The person in the Chevy Assistance line was wonderful as well.

      "I tried to use my on-star phone to call home and got a message that my minutes had expired. I had a previous balance of 900 minutes. When I call ON-Star the Customer Service Representative said that the plans for minutes had changed and that they were no on a 3 month renewal. He said that there was an e-mail notification sent in December 2020. (I have checked all my e-mails from ON-Star and could not locate this specific e-mail). He further stated that the new system DOES NOT send any reminder e-mails. I also thought he said that I would get a reminder call to let me know my minutes are expiring. I think that this new system is poor and lacks the level of customer service that we expect from ON-Star. In addition, I recently had surgery and was not able to drive for two months. It just so happens that those two months were in the \"period of time\" that I was suppose to get my \"reminder calls\". Also, I get calls to my car phone that I have no idea who is calling and don't answer the phone. IT would be customer service friendly to notify customer what the phone number is so that they know they should answer the call. What kind of customer service makes it as difficult as possible for the customer. As I mentioned earlier there could be MANY reasons (Surgeries, Family Emergencies, Weather events, etc.) which would impede the individuals ability to use their car. I would suggest you restore the service of notifying customers by e-mail as a \"back-up.\" The Customer Service Representative did restore my minutes and I was grateful he could do that without making me go through the process of trying to find out who to contact.\n",

She only unlocked it when I wanted to talk to a supervisor. Then I was charged $111 on my account and when I called to ask about it, it was from charges LAST YEAR that I was unaware about. And then when she transferred me to someone else. They wanted to argue with me about canceling my account. And still couldn’t give me my money back. I was unaware of those charges and they were over a year old, which I think are ridiculous.

The first time I called the guy said I won’t be charged until October. I was charged in September, so I called again to cancel services because I just didn’t want to deal with it. The girl who answered was also trying to have me keep the service, and only canceled it when I got snappy. I don’t like having to get to that point. I know customer service is hard, but corporations making them repeat sales pitches makes it harder for them, because customers, like me, get annoyed. We’re all adults, we know what we need/like, we don’t need the sales pitch, especially if we are trying to cancel the service.

      "My car started making a very loud noise while driving on an intra-state highway. It sounded like maybe I'd had a blown out tire. I pulled over and checked my tires but they appeared to be fine. I drove back onto he highway and at first there was no noise. As soon as I got up to a higher speed the noise returned. That is when I contacted On Star. I asked the assistant to perform a diagnostic test. She did and reported the results to me in a couple of minutes and everything appeared to be fine. The next morning I took my car to the local Firestone auto service. The problem was that the splash guard had apparently come loose and part of it had been rubbed away. The remainder was flopping up and down causing the noise at high speed. They did a temporary fix by pushing the guard back in place and securing it with push pins. I have not had the opportunity to test their \"fix\" yet. I don't usually get up to more than 45 to 50 miles per hour in my day to day driving. In any case I am very relieved to know that it wasn't anything major to worry about. If it occurs again I will have the guard either replaced or removed.\n",

After the trial period was over I was charged $24.99. I called to ask why I was charged that amount since I was told in May I would receive the same coverage that I had on my previous vehicle for the same price, but was told that offer no longer exists. I told them that i was told that the price was locked in (for life) when I called back in May but they still would not honor it. I asked them to cancel my service & do not plan to reinstate it.

      "I received a letter in the mail x2 advising that my service was to expire in November, 2021. A. The 1st letter only advised such & with contact info only. B. On 10-6-21, I called On Star to again sign up for services for the upcoming 2022 year. C. Then, the next day 10-07-21, I received the 2nd letter the day after I called ON Star to sign up for services again. This letter gave NO DETAILS of the plans, only that there were the 3 plans available. And appearances that the least costly plan had changed from the prior On-Star plan offered. a. Why would ON Star send customers such a letter VOID of any information?? b. This leads me to believe that On -Star expects their customers to go to their computers to explore their choices??? Why? This is POOR service and is void of common sense when On-Star already spent $$ to print and send a letter! c. So, I called On-Star and I questioned why the change and or difference in the Protection Plan versus the \"new plan\" which appeared in the info I received, And was this \"unidentified\" new plan to replace what I just purchased; Ie; the Protection Plan? d. The response I received made little sense, and left me still questioning what I actually purchased for 2022. e. This inadequate type of customer service only infuriates a customer and leaves a customer questioning what is being offered. And what was purchased since there is nothing in writing for my purchase!\n",

      "Was not too happy with the call that I made to add minutes to my OnStar phone account. The first person could not verify how many minutes were left and the expiration date. I had called a few months ago and had what I thought was the expiration date but wanted to be sure of date and minutes. I also needed the cost of purchasing the smallest amount of minutes. The second person gave me that info. but then could not process the order so I had to speak with a third person. I only had a short time to finish this call - so this was frustrating. I did not receive a reminder email to purchase minutes before they expired. Luckily my notes were correct about the expiration date but then I found out that the smallest amount of minutes was now 100 minutes - which is a lot for a person like me that only keeps a small amount of minutes on my account to keep it open to use for emergencies. It was nice that the price decreased to $9.99 but now minutes are only good for 3 months. WHEN DID THAT CHANGE? I WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THIS! So the cost did not really decrease as now I will have to purchase 400 minutes per year (way too many) and this will now cost me $40 per year when I think it was less than $20 to buy a small amount of minutes that lasted one year. I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT AS A SENIOR ON A FIXED INCOME, THIS WILL CAUSE ME TO RE-THINK MY PLAN TO KEEP THE ONSTAR ACCOUNT OPEN. WHY WERE WE NOT NOTIFIED OF THIS CHANGE? NOT HAPPY!!\n",

After almost 2 hours, and after my husband showed up, I canceled the roadside assistance we needed. We drove back to Searcy, arrived around 1am. On July 30, we drove back to Fort Smith, contacted the dealership, which was little help since their service dept don’t work weekends. After going back to where my car was to reach out to roadside assistance once again. The person on the phone was friendly, as said someone should be out in about 30 minutes. Once we received contact info on the tow office, they said they were busy but someone would be out soon. All in all I guess they were quick enough. They were 30 minutes late but did pick up the car and delivered it to the dealership. Once they call and say they have the vehicle ready for pick up we will make the drive back to the dealership, pay the deductible , pick up the car and head back home. This will make the 3rd trip my husband has to drive up there and his truck isn’t the cheapest thing to drive. Just ready for your whole ordeal to be over with. Probably more disappointed in the car than anything else. 32000 miles and left me stranded.\n",

It would have been even better if I had been told take it in for service at your convenience, which is what the follow-up email said. Since, I wasn’t aware of that, I called my dealer to find out if it would be okay to drive it home (we were about 400 miles from home). It took about an hour and repeated phone calls to have the dealer say try it and call us back if you have any more issues. By the way, we made it home without issue and had an appointment on Monday to address the issue.

All other functions on the app are useless to me and in some way insulting that you think that I want to buy Chevy logo merchandise using a phone app. The app should focus on mechanical and electrical functions of the vehicle and nothing else. If you truly want input for improved functionality, I have two: (1) from the app allow setting the target SOC% for the active charging session (I can do this from the car but not the app). (2) from the app allow setting the current (amps) used at home for the active charging session at 240v (no, not the useless 8/12 amp 120v setting). I also own a Tesla 2020 Model Y which provides those features and I often change these settings.

I had this problem several times in the past with On-Star and was told that the minutes could not carry over to the next year. The reason that I had those minutes because of technical issues with On-Star. Each time I have called in the past, the minutes were restored. I also made sure that they recorded an issue so that there so that the history would be recorded in the files. Yesterday, when I called I asked the person to check the records to verify that she should see my previous issues. She indicated that she saw that in my files.

Your representative was hard to understand but my understanding is that On-Star was no longer offering the minutes. We went through several minutes where she was unable to explain why the minutes could not be restored. I was very frustrated because On-Start was not available when I needed to make a call and the Operator was of no help. I finally asked to talk with a manager, the Operator said that she would connect me. The next thing that I know is that I got disconnected. The manager never called me back. So, not only was your operator unhelpful but I was not able to speak to a manager to resolve my issue. Again, this same issue has occurred several times in the past and while this was frustrating I was at least able to get my minutes restored with a phone call to On-Star. This time was different.

      "As an GM/Chevy car buyer for well over 15 years and an On-Star user since 2008 I was extremely disappointed to learn that On-Star is doing away with the calling feature, provided by Verizon, in February 2022. One of the primary reasons I was drawn back to buying GM products was because of the On-Star feature, but specifically the hands-free calling. It seems GM/On-Star has been reducing the capabilities of On-Star, because when I bought my new 2018 Chevy I discovered (unfortunately after the purchase) that the hands-free calling by name feature was no longer supported. This feature was in place since my fist new GM purchase in 2008, and was a real disappointment to find it no longer available. Then when I needed to purchase more minutes for my system 3 months ago I was not told those minutes would expire in 3 months, nor that the hands-free calling feature was being discontinued. So now I a left with mostly worthless extra feature on my vehicle, On-Star, that I paid quite a bit additional money to get, only to discover that a few years later the feature was being discontinued. I was told the decision to discontinue this feature was not GM/On-Star's but rather Verizon Wireless, the company actually providing the current service. This seems strange, because at no time in the past 14 years that I have had On-Star did any one at Chevy or GM even mention who the carrier was, or that the carrier, not GM/On-Star, controlled the service. But that is immaterial to me the GM/Chevy/On-Star customer. I am loosing a much desired feature. It seems then to me that GM/Chevy/On-Star sees little value in customer satisfaction, and I can't imagine that any GM/Chevy/On-Star user will be happy about this decision. I should think that if GM/Chevy/On-Star really valued its customers it wold have done everything in its power to force Verizon to retain this feature. A better option than disabling the feature across the board would to continue to provide it to those customers that have it and want it, but not to continue it forward on newer models. This would gradually allow the feature to be discontinued, if this is really GM/Chevy/On-Star's decision. Another option other than a complete removal of the feature would be to increase the price for the additional calling minutes, there by allowing those who wished to keep the feature to do so. It would seem to me, a long time GM/Chevy/On-Star customer, these options would be preferable to a compete removal of the feature. I would think that GM/Chevy/On-Star is a large enough company and obviously a significant customer of Verizon that pressure could be put on Verizon to continue the service in some manner. Otherwise, for my next vehicle purchase I will seriously have to consider a brand other than GM/Chevy.\n",

      "My experience was horrible! The first time I called was around 6:45 pm to GM Roadside Assistance. The GM Roadside Assistance rep told me based on the model and year of the car I will have a spare tire and a driver was dispatched. There was not a spare tire in the trunk. The dispatched driver told me to call back for a tow truck and left. The second time I called was around 8:00 pm to GM Roadside Assistance I was told the car will be towed to Matix Chevrolet. When we got there building was closed and nowhere secure to leave my car. I asked the driver could he tow my car home. He said no. That was not allowed. But, he would if paid him a 120 dollars. I said no, then he told me I have to call GM Roadside Assistance again for another tow driver. I asked him to stay until I made the call to see if they would allow him to tow the car to another secured dealership. He left me a the front gate of the dealership. The third call around 9:30 pm I asked the GM Roadside rep to make sure the other dealership was secured location. He said it was and dispatched another tow truck. I was told the driver would be there in 1 hour. The driver did not show up within the hour window. I called him and he told me it would be another hour or more before he could get to me. It’s now after 10:30 pm. He told me he had to go downriver first then to me. He already know it would be over a hour before he would get to me. I guess he didn’t want to lose not on guaranteed money and that I had no choice but to wait. I told him that was unacceptable. Then he proceeded to tell me to leave my keys in the car and would make sure it gets to the dealership. I told him do you really think I’m going to leave my UNLOCKED CAR with the key in it! I asked him what Am I going to tell my insurance company if someone steals my car. Then he suggested I lock the car and leave the key behind the front tire. Again what am I going to tell my insurance company if someone steals my car! By his time I am frustrated, tired and want to go home. The fourth time I called GM Roadside Assistance was around 11:00 pm I was told they would try to find someone who could came faster. The first driver they contacted would be 75 minutes. I told them that some unacceptable! Then I was told they found a driver would could be there in 45 minutes. So I waited until MIDNIGHT and called the driver… no answer! Then I waited 10 to 15 minutes and called back. The driver answers and tells me someone will be there in 10 to 15 minutes. NO ONE SHOWED!!! Finally I drove my car with a flat tire around the side of the lot near another locked gate and left it praying it would be okay until morning!! I did not get home until after 1am!! The service and the experience was very disappointing and unacceptable!!!\n",

I called using blue button at 310pm and was told a tow service was on the way..... at 510pm I called the number provided and cti towing told me that Allstate denied me ?... I do not have anything to do with Allstate.... i pay onstar.... they wanted me to pay more to them direct... ?.... I called onstar again using the blue button and they said they would find another towing service and would be there in 23 minutes... That was not true.... after 50 minutes Eagle towing driver called me and asked if I still needed the tow and said that if I did he would come but would be about 53 more minutes..... finally around 745 he showed up with a small truck and said he should not try to haul my truck but was going to try.... I was reluctant but I had be on the side of the road since 3pm so.... my truck barely fit on tow truck and when he picked my truck up his front tires came off the ground..... and his left back tire went half flat so the whole truck liened to the left..... he took my truck to the dealership 26 miles away . He could only drive 35 miles an hour..... it took 6 hours to get my vehicle to the dealer in the Houston area ?... I saw may tow trucks drive by and onstar provided me this service after 9 years of paying for the service... VERY POOR.\n",

      "The initial contact with OnStar and Chevrolet Roadside assistance was very good. I liked the text messages and Roadside assistance site. Where it fell apart was finding the rescue tow company and their lack of communication and transparency. I waited for almost 4 hours for the tow truck to arrive on the side of the road in 100 degree weather. The worst part is after calling the tow company to check, they could not give me any kind of answer or status update. They were difficult to understand and would not even pick up the phone at times. The app from Chevy Roadside assistance is great but it's not useful unless the information in it is accurate and owned by the third party providers. I completely understand Chevy is dealing with third party companies and labor shortages are an issue impacting drivers. However it is unacceptable to not be able to get an accurate ETA. I nearly went with another company and would have paid out of the pocket to get better service. This experience is having me consider other options in the future for Roadside assistance.\n",

      "My lease broke down 3 hours away from home. I was forced to recently extend my lease which was up on 6/1 because with this market there are NO cars currently available and they have to be ordered & built. A coolant hose popped off which caused my entire engine to shut down which the dealership ended up having to reconnect. First issue was that the tow truck driver towed my car to a dealership and didn’t leave any contact information for me or why it was there. Thankfully I had a friend who lived in the area who went to the shop for me on Monday when they opened. Second issue was because my bumper to bumper warranty was expired and because I had to extend my lease under NO fault of my own…you guys would not tow my vehicle home for me or cover expenses for a rental car. I had to pay out of pocket to drive 3 hours away to pick up my vehicle and then drive it back home. The dealership refused to even give me a loaner. As someone who has given my business to GM for 6 years, I am truly disappointed in the way this was handled. I will not be leasing through GM again.\n",

      "Starting at 6 pm Saturday, I called roadside for my 70 year old mother to get the car towed out of a parking garage. I specifically stated when asked was there anything wrong with the tires and I said no but the axel boot is broken and it's in a parking garage. I had to call several times to get this issue taken care of and even the second wrong tow driver they sent out called their company and told them the same thing. After waiting several hours for them to send someone I called the tow company to find out they didn't have anyone to send until next day. By this time it's after 10 p.m. the type company called roadway towing did come next day. But this is ridiculous trouble. There were several inconvenient moments 1. No signal to car cause it was in a parking garage so I had to call from another of my vehicles and explain the vehicle I called from was not the vehicle needing service however they are both Cadillac 2 they kept sending the wrong tow truck which caused me to not get any service till next day 3i was transferred to a Canadian gm or on star rep that did not speak good English 3 earlier this month tried using onstar for the navigation and it never sent signal to the car and none of the reps offered to do the turn by turn navigation. I already reduced my policy on 1 vehicle and thinking just canceling my policy on both vehicles. I was very inconvenienced.\n",

He said he did but he said he would send me an email to confirm but I never got it so I do not know if he cancelled it and I do not want to be billed for it again in September. If he did not cancel it please cancel my wifi and all other services immediately and send me a cancellation confirmation email at JALOLLER@aol.com. Also just a little side information, the wifi signal was never very strong even though I called and let them know before. It was good for playing music from my phone but not strong enough to use the web browser from the car usually. And the last time I tried I could not get a signal at all. I just want to let someone know but I definitely need to cancel. Thank you!\n",

I called and was given to three (3) different advisors, explaining my need for information to make an informed renewal. After, I got disconnected and issues with the website, I was very annoyed and ready to cancel my service and not renew. When I call this time and chose the option to cancel my service, I was connected to a wonderful retention advisor who directed me to the OnStar website, stepped through the plan options, including one (10 not on the website. I was finally able to make an informed decision for an annual renewal that did not break my finances. The advisor explained addition information concerning my OnStar service and being able to use it as my 2G is being sunset-ted and how the hands free minutes are going away by Dec 2022. Thanks to this advisor I renewed my OnStar service and I have information on options to upgrade the OnStar for my vehicle.\n",

      "The call center lady that took my initial call was very helpful and concern about my safety. She scheduled the tow to pick me up. The tow truck took 3 hours to arrive even though the said will be 90-120 mins. The amoun of time that took the tow to arrive was in no way GM faults. At 2 hr mark the tow company message me that they have arrive, which was not the case. Probably they did that to let GM that they were on time. However not the case. They arrive one hour later than scheduled time. They arrive at 4:05 am. The most frustrating part with GM was that since the tow didn’t arrive and they alerted me that they were there, I tried calling GM again and the automated system kept offering me a link to get status. I had status and was erroneous because the tow truck didn’t arrive. When finally the automated system gave me an option to speak with someone, the wait time was over 20 mins. Wait times should not be 20 mins when you are stranded at 3 am and unable to charge your phone.\n",

I’m already frustrated that my brand new 22, 3 month old vehicle is leaving me stranded, 4hrs from home, packed for vacation. I then called back because I called the tech that was assigned (after 30 min of me waiting) and he said that he had been trying to call dispatch because my request was stuck in a cue and the phone number they gave him for me wasn’t going through?? So then a third call back to ask for a different dealer location (one that would be much closer to our vacation address) and she told me she updated it, then the truck arrives and says no he has to take it to point A because no one ever changed it. So yeah, the whole process was frustrating and I’m really glad it wasn’t an emergency because I don’t have much confidence in how it would be handled.\n",

When I mentioned the name of the store, the voice back was not understandable and I thought I was being sent to a different location. With memory working for me, I found the store. Following all of this, when I started the car, OnStar would come on again without a prompt from me to tell me that I had left the planned route. This happened even though I had requested \"cancel route.\" A day later, while at home, OnStar comes on again asking for information that I did not request. This was a carry-over from the previous day. Once again I said to \"cancel route.\" I have been an OnStar customer for a few years. This was my worst experience. Kinks need to be work out! Until then, there is no replacement for a LIVE VOICE! If this situation continues, I may not renew my subscription service.\n",

I was four hours away, so obviously couldn't come to help her.

I said not to worry, that they knew exactly where she was and would come to help her, so just push the button. Your people sent help, pulled her car back onto the road, helped her to get a new tire, and literally saved her life. THANK YOU!

      "While I only called On Star once, I found it extremely difficult to work with the customer service people as I was continually transferred to a person's supervisor. I was trying to cancel my account as I own an older car with systems no longer supported by On Star (due to cell phone companies dropping 2G support). I contacted the cancellation number listed on the email received from On Star figuring that this would take me to a part of On Star support designed to cancel services for vehicles no longer supported. I was wrong - I talked to a customer support person most likely located off-shore as the person and all the supervisors had extreme accents that were nearly impossible to decipher via the phone. Seriously, I only wanted to comply with On Star's email telling me that if I didn't need the new On Star App, I should simply cancel my account and that On Star would refund any money still on my account. However, the first person I talked to would not let me cancel the service and tried to convince me why the app would give me everything that the On Star button did except for the emergency services. I only had the emergency services activated on On Star so I didn't need what the app provided and especially with the need to pay the full On Star price - what a rip-off. The first person finally said that they could not do this so I needed their supervisor. The person transferred me to the supervisor and guess what - again the person tried to talk me into the app. I told them that I already had all the emergency features I needed from my insurance companies free app and again the person continued to try and convince me that I needed the app. Finally, I got to the next level supervisor who was somewhat abrupt with me but allowed me to cancel my service. While I had On Star, the service provided me with good support for the first six or so years. After that (approximately 2019), the quality of service decreased and On Star informed me that the satellite could not always see my vehicle. OK, I can live with that as I do park my car in a northerly facing garage so no big deal but it seemed that after this time service quality suffered. Could it be that General Motors moved On Star services off-shore at that time? I don't know as when I called for support, I get US-based service but this time, all people who I contacted spoke broken English and had very deep accents making it difficult for me to understand. At that point, I knew that On Star or its app was no longer for me. I do not mind moving services off-shore as GM is a global company. I support a businesses right to earn a profit and support using global resources to their advantage. However, when a loyal 10+ year customer receives an email telling the customer that their vehicle no longer has the capability to connect with On Star (no fault of On Star or GM as this was a cell company decision to stop 2G support) and when this loyal customer accepts this fact, then the offering company should honor their email using clear instructions to their customer support staff to simply comply with the customers request and stop using used-car sales tactics to try and sell something that a person does not need or cannot use (On Star's words, not mine) something that the person already has through their insurance company.\n",

Cadillac Roadside Assistance did not give the information, which I affirmed that you did in fact have, to our tow driver about the location of our key. Therefore our key was lost in transit and it has been a two day ordeal, which is not over yet, to have the flat tire replaced on our car while we are on a trip. We must have the car on Monday, Labor Day, when we get back into the Atlanta airport in order to drive home to South Carolina. We will have to have it towed again out of the locked lot at the Cadillac dealership in order for it to be accessible to us on Monday. Not only that we will have to get another key made at quite an expense to us. I feel like Cadillac Roadside Assistance should reimburse us for any and all expenses associated with this error.\n",

      "I found myself in a jam. I needed to lock (MAKE SURE!) the doors of my GM vehicle. I was on the parking shuttle to the airport when I realized I wasn't ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE I locked the doors. As we were leaving the parking lot the driver asked everyone if they had their ID, Passports, wallet, purse, papers, tickets, keys, ALL their baggage, pets and kids (LOL)... Then I heard a man say aloud \" I don't think I locked the doors \" followed by a woman sitting a short distance away with a few kids in between respond \" I checked and they are locked \". While on the parking shuttle I tried the myGMC app that I have used MANY!!!!! times since purchasing this GM vehicle. The menu was different. I tried just about every menu item looking for the KEYFOB functions, nothing. I did see a page where it said to push the blue button to get started,, but since I already had used the service I didn't think I needed to do that. And I don't recall having to push the blue button when I accessed the app the first time. I was able to log in but the information provided didn't make it clear that I no longer had service and steps required to start service again.. I tried the app again once seated on the plane, obviously with no luck.. A few hours later after arriving at my destination I immediately called onstar looking for person to person help. That didn't work out for me... The person I spoke with made it clear the only way to lock the doors,,,, I needed to be \"in the vehicle\" (push the blue button)... IF,,, I was physically able to be in the vehicle, obviously I wouldn't have any use for the myGMC app services. I simply cannot believe myGMC app cannot access my vehicle at any time.. I really feel this is a punishment (push the blue button) from onstar because I didn't renew the myGMC service and it had lapsed. FYI!!!!! I haven't had a use for the myGMC service since I haven't traveled more than a few miles from home in over 20 months. In the pre-FAKE pandemic days I did make full use of myGMC KeyFob app features many times (very convenient). I never really had a use for onstar services because the Primary use of this vehicle (2015 Terrain) is 'Too and From Work' and I know the route. So basically in over 20 months I haven't used or more importantly NEEDED (had a use for) the myGMC app services or any of the onstar services. But on 11/21/2021 I NEEDED HELP. I needed the services from myGMC app. The live onstar assistant told me I had to be IN THE VEHICLE and PUSH the blue button to link the vehicle to onstar in order to activate the myGMC app features.... Then how is it I continue to get email regarding the service requirements based on vehicle mileage or service required alerts (low tire pressure). How do you know the mileage or safety/service alerts if your not linked to the vehicle....? That doesn't add up.....\n",

      "On Star is a wonderful service and feature and I've enjoyed having it for several years now. But the one really annoying aspect of On Star is the resemblance it has to my old AOL internet provider from over thirty years ago. And that is, once you sign up, you make it EXTREMELY difficult to cancel a subscription. The agent I spoke with made multiple attempts (about four) to continue my subscription even after I had told her that I was merely calling to cancel my subscription because I'm old and no longer drive and that my truck merely sets in my garage and never gets moved. She would try and try again to offer me a better rate and I would again explain to her, it's not about the rate or the service provided. It's the fact that the truck is no longer being driven and sets parked in my very secure garage. Therefore, I no longer have need of the On Star service. I've been a good and faithful customer for years and I know that what she did is \"Standard Operating Procedure\" as I've been put through this same process several times over the past several years by different On Star agents when I've called previously to cancel due to affordability. The reasoning for her repeated attempts yesterday for me to continue my subscription after I so clearly explained to her that the truck was no longer being driven was maddening and demonstrated very poor customer service. All the while, I kept my composure never getting upset with the agent as I know that this is not an agent issue but a Managerial issue where the agents are being pressured to act in this fashion. So, \"yes\", I would recommend On Star for the services they provide. But I would also advise anyone to beware that should you ever decide to cancel your subscription, be prepared for ten to fifteen minutes of un-due hassle.\n",

And BOOM, there appears a charge for $79.97 for both our vehicles. So not only did it put me over my limit but was reported to the Credit Bureau! The gentleman that helped me cancel this and refund me was very understanding and nice to me!! I don’t know who you have calling your customers to renew their usage of On Star, but something needs to be fixed! We are retired and live on a fixed income where every penny is accounted for! If I get any insufficient funds charges because of this, I’ll be contacting you back for repayment if those possible funds!!! So the high score I gave BELONGS to the Representative that assisted me!!!\n",

      "As you know as I got a message the other day on the 25th that you will no longer be providing OnStar* to my vehicle you you’re giving us the OnStar* Guardian app. Which the app really sucks if you wanna know the truth the main reason I have OnStar* is so I can remotely start my car which I will not be able to do anymore after December which is the main reason I got the OnStar* app I think it’s terrible that you are removing all vehicles from 2015 and below from OnStar* when over a year ago you (General Motors) said you were going to get a adapter of some sort for my vehicle which I was quite happy about then. This month pretty much said no screw you and said we’re not gonna take care of you anymore take care of the OnStar* app you’re giving us is crappy Guardian app I think that really hurts your customer appreciation. So what else is bullshit is say I forget my phone at home go to town for a quick drive getting a car accident and get knocked unconscious her son and I won’t be able to call the police or fire rescue so then the Guardian app is like I said worthless. And what else irritates me as I have a really nice Cadillac car that still has under 100,000 miles on it and barely looks like it has 100,000 miles on it I’d like to keep this car for a few more years instead of having to buy a new one so I can still use the OnStar app.\n",

So as soon as I got off the ramp and onto the interstate and a safe place to get off I pulled over. When I talk to the people on roadside assistance I told them that I was stopped right behind the overhead sign that said the next exit was 177 going south with an exit to 11 I sat there from a little after 730 till after nine I had to call them a couple times because I never heard from the person that they said was going to come get me they said I would be contacted by A text. I believe I got four texts that said due to a shortage in help it was going to take longer. After like the fourth text like that I called back and they said they weren’t really sure where I was located. Overall my friend got there about 930 and I went to her car and we had to try to help them find my location. Everything was on my phone location my math was on and frankly I didn’t think the people were very friendly and I was a little stressed out. Eventually about 9:45 the man coming to get my car told me just to leave the keys in the car and I could leave because we were having a torrential lightning storm and I told that to the people on the phone it’s not like I could just get out of my car. My car got to where it was supposed to go and it was fixed. I have used OnStar many times and I have never had this difficult of a situation\n",

Thank you again Tia for your help and for all that you did to keep me with On Star because Stella told me that I needed this Company and like I told her I had AARP, my own insurance and another one that I didn’t need her.

But when it got near the 2hour mark they said tow should be arriving in 10 minutes. We looking for about 20 minutes. NoTow! Another alert said your tow has arrived?? I called the tow company (they said it should be there shortly?? But called back and said he was caught in traffic for about 15 more minutes.

Also I informed that the people when I called that my vehicle did not start at all so when the tow truck got here which was a flatbed he never was informed that so he was upset. Also I was covered for 100 miles and I when I called the guy told me yes you're covered he even spoke with his supervisor however it never got relayed to the tow truck driver and he tried to tell me I owed him $60 and he had to call back to confirm.

      "Around 3/5/2020 I was given a Onstar loyalty rate of $19.99, because I have been an Onstar customer for many years.I could keep the rate for as long as I wanted. On 6/13/2020 I called to ask if I could pay it annually. The agent said I could not have that rate if paid annually and it would be more money. I said to forget it and I would continue the monthly payments. A few days later I received a email that my new monthly rate would be $34.99. I called Onstar and the agent said it was too late and she had already change my plan to annual and it would cost me $34.99/month. After talking with her supervisor they adjusted things with a credit and I was able to pay what I was the remainder of 2020. I was told I could sign up on 1/12/2021 for a new Guardian plan at the same monthly rate I had and the rate would be extended for as long as I wanted. I just found out that this loyaty plan expires at the end of this year and I would more than double my present rate. I need my plan to not expire, stay at the same monthly rate for as long as I want. I have been an Onstar customer starting on my 2007 Avalanche and 2014 Acadia, and 2018 Acadia. In more than 15 years I have only used Onstar to unlock my doors 2 times. I have paid thousands of dollars for this. I want the security of Onstar but I will not pay the higher rate after the first of the year. According to the supervisor , Cherise, she said this has all been written up in my account. Please review this and let me know if I will be able to continue my plan on the 2018 Acadia for as long as I want.

      "I’ve had trouble with this app for years. The latest version I’m running (5.15.1 (6))) seems to be working the best. The biggest problem has been maintaining connectivity with my car. For well over a year I would constantly get the message to restart my car to reestablish connectivity—defeating the purpose. A number of things are not intuitive in the app design, in particular the button with my initials and the “More” button. Overall, as I have a Bolt EV, it seems like the app is a “one-size-fits-all” attempt to work with all Chevrolet cars, when ideally there would be a standalone app just for your electric vehicles, as they are unique from ICE vehicles. Plus, OnStar told me in May I’d have to pay minimum $23.99/mo for this mediocre experience, only to find in July that there’s actually a “Remote Connectivity” plan for half that at $11.99/mo, primarily so I can see my SOC (State-Of-Charge) remotely, and occasionally precondition my car (“Remote Start” for ICE vehicles). Another issue was launching the app from Apple CarPlay and previously I would get the message to log in to the app when parked—that wasn’t helpful if I wanted to see any data not native to the car’s on-board system, like a precise SOC reading. This latest version hasn’t given me that message, fortunately. Also, previous versions required a 4-digit PIN in addition to the username and password, and this version is happily loading faster without the 4-digit PIN. Overall, this latest version is the one I’m most-pleased with and seems to finally work as expected (it’s been years, folks), though I admit to anticipating it failing in one way or another.

I realize inflation is causing prices on goods and services to rise and that is not something you can control. But my income does not go up unless the government votes for a cost of living increase.

      "I have a 2008 DTS. As recently as May 2021 I had purchased additional minutes for my phone and had accumulated over 700. On Sunday I made a call and was told I didn't have any minutes. I contacted Onstar from my car and was on hold and when finally answered I could not hear nor understand the Onstar rep,. I was disconnected and tried again. A small wait and another a similar experience but I was informed there are no minutes and that I was notified in March by email. To the best of my knowledge I have received no communication about this matter. When I got home I decided to call Onstar from my home phone and see if I could get an explanation. From what I was told I believe I can use the car phone but someone will transfer the call but I cannot receive calls. After investigation my car is not bluetooth enabled since that began with 2009 models. I feel betrayed by Cadillac and ill informed. In 2001 my dad had purchased a new Cadillac DHS for the safety features with the phone being a prominent incentive. In 2008 I bought this car for him since the phone system in his car was no longer active, analog technology was not supported. Twice we have had a similar experience i.e. the phone system does not work due to tech advances. To make matters worse both cars were equipped with a Northstar engine and the 2001 had a problem with the engine. Generally I have loved Cadillacs and my family has purchased 14 beginning in 1976. The last two models have become obsolete or 'defective' because of the engine and phone features. Finally with all of the Onstar calls I made on Sunday, 3, each was answered with a recorded message that everyone was busy and there would be a wait. My call wasn't an emergency but I was concerned that the promptness and reliability that I have come to expect from Cadillac doesn't fit the current conditions. Thank you for contacting me and listening to my issues.\n",

      "Your people doing directions are not very knowledge. I don't use navigation very often, but the few time I have used it I had to have the direction I had to call back back several times to get correct directions. Children screaming in the background and rude clerks giving directions. I called about 4 or 5 days to complain about the service. I was told tat someone would call me back. STILL WAITING! I am planning a trip in July and have always had great service in the past years, not really looking for the service I might receive. You can't be doing your housework working on your facebook account or taking care of your children when you are suppose to be doing your work for clients. Bring them back to the work place where they can give good service and concentrate on the work they are suppose to be doing. I am being cheated and so is your business!

The staff on the phone were cheerful and offered help … and we understand about staffing shortages…and patience … but it still was a long wait!

      "The advisors I spoke to were courteous and informed, but they could not help me with the underlying problem. I am very upset, dissatisfied, and disappointed that my access to hands-free calling in my vehicles has been taken away. Yes, I understand that my two 2008 vehicles have 2 G technology that will soon be obsolete and no longer able to function in the cellular system. But there is NO reason for dropping it from my 2016 and 2017 vehicles, (4 G tech). The fact that I can still connect with an Onstar advisor by hitting the \"blue button\" proves that. My wife and I live in a very rural area of Colorado, and there are times and places when hand held cell phones lose service. It is my understanding that the cell phone in the vehicle has a 3 watt output instead of the .6 watt output of my hand held unit. That difference may make the difference between a call being unable to connect, or going through. Yes I know that I can pair my hand held through Bluetooth, and I do, but if service is sketchy, that doesn't help. I'd like to know how you are going to compensate me for taking away one of the features that I bought and paid for when the vehicles were purchased. Again, I am VERY VERY dissatisfied with Onstar currently.\n",

OnStar couldn’t help, AAA couldn’t get a reading on their fancy machine, AAA couldn’t get the Tahoe on a battery jump. Called GM roadside assistance and they could tow me in 4 hours. Went home for a few hours waiting for a tow truck. Google “2022 Tahoe won’t start” and a U-tube video popped up and instructed us to disconnect the “negative battery cable” for 30 seconds and put it back on. The car started right up. This must be a problem because several people commented on the U-tube video that their car wouldn’t start either. Saved by U-tube. GM should be ashamed. My husband travels and I have a new car for reliability …..and here I was stranded on a parking lot with my $80K brand new car. Can you please forward this problem to someone who may care.\n",

I asked was there a problem with my account or my vehicle and I was told no, they just wanted to know if I wanted to upgrade my service. Never said anything about not being able to get a payment and then the other day, I have now, four pending charges of $43.69. When I called to try to figure out what was going on, I got sent to three different people before they sent me to billing and even after I was processing my cancellation, I was asked if I still wanted to do a discounted service.

      "My vehicle broke down on I-55 around the County Line Road exit in Ridgeland, MS. I needed a towing service. The lady helping me was professional and courteous and told me she had secured a towing service for me and the estimated time of arrival was 40 minutes. After 30 minutes or so I received a text saying there had been a delay and the estimated arrival time was now 51 minutes. When the towing service arrived I noticed on the cab of his truck that he was from Vicksburg, MS. There are plenty of towing services in the Jackson, MS metro area so having someone drive all the way from Vicksburg didn’t make any sense to me. I originally called around 4pm and the towing service didn’t get there until 5:45. I could’ve called a local towing service myself and gotten someone there faster. Sitting on the side of the interstate for nearly two hours in 90 degree temp was very unpleasant. My vehicle wouldn’t go into neutral so the towing service had to drag my vehicle onto the tow truck. I had it towed to Herrin-Gear Chevrolet where I get the vehicle serviced. The towing service had a hard time unloading my vehicle because the rear wheels wouldn’t roll. I’m afraid there may be some damage to the underside or front bumper of my vehicle. I’m waiting to hear back from the dealership.

      "I activated wi-fi in July because of a family trip. I called in August to cancel and was sent to the cancellation department where I was told that department's system was down and would not be able to help me and that I'd have to call back at another time. I did not end up calling again till September where I waited on hold for over 30 minutes and finally hung up. I finally remembered to call again this weekend which happened to be the day after I was charged for the entire months service. I was able to get through and speak with someone to cancel service and was then told that my service would end that day although I paid for the entire month in advance and could not be refunded any part of my payment. I think its ridiculous that if I was charged for the entire month I cant cancel my service for the upcoming month and keep the service I've already paid for. I also think its ridiculous that all services are auto renewed unless you call to cancel. For a supposed reputable service provider, these business practices seem similar to the likes of scammers. In the future I will find other means of acquiring wifi capabilities for my vehicle to avoid dealing with these unreasonable business practices.\n",

      "I got COVID and serious viral and bacterial pneumonia last August 2020. I was in 2 hospitals and 3 nursing homes for 106 days. In the beginning, I was in ICU in critical condition intubated x 2 and in a coma. My family had several calls that things did not look good for me. So, it was an extremely long recovery but has left me using a wheel chair and walker to get around. I have only driven 4 times in the last month. Still getting stronger so my car was driven several times by family members during that time. Very little driving during this time. No needs to contact On Star during that time. Right now I am still trying to drive more often. If I do get back to driving regular I will probably set up the On Star again. COVID almost killed me but my Heavenly Father brought me back home. I always want to tell my story to those who have not heard it or have not gotten their shots that COVID is no joke. Sadly, as we know, it can kill you.

Over all, I waited over 6hrs for service, dealt with horrible customer service, missed my parts order window at the mechanic because my vehicle got to them much later than expected, and missed work because I spent hours with my car when it should've been picked up sooner than 6hrs.

      "Sound quality with the service is horrible. I could not understand clearly to communicate with the people. I originally reached out to On-star to cancel my service. I stated I could not justify paying $35 a month to GM when the car I purchased fails to meet the specs and usability stated when I purchased it(2020 Chevy Bolt battery limit parking charging overnight leaving in my garage). I had to go through three levels of people to even cancel my service. I verified when the billing period was and cancelled it immediately so it would not have to pay another month. The very next day my card was billed again. I called back again and first agent that answered i kept talking to him he obviously couldn’t hear me and hung up( he sounded like he was in a 5 gallon bucket same as all the ones i talked with the day before). I called back again get an agent explain that i was billed when I should not have been. She tells me I should have called billing. I tell her I don’t get an option of who I am callingI have an Onstar button on my dash that Is my only option. She transfers me to billing. This person is the first one that Ihave a clear connection that I can understand (and I tell her that) she checks and says the agent the day before set it to end in November. She fixed apologized for her co worker not cancelling it properly. It is ridiculous to have to go through that many levels to cancel your service. It is even more ridiculous to have to go through that many levels and have to explain each time what you have told each level before. And to top it off it is ridiculous to pay for a service and when you do use it to not be able to understand the agent not because of an accent but because of poor equipment quality. I would not consider even consider Onstar (GM) service again without 1. The car be able to perform the way it was sold to me (charging, parking inside my garage and range) 2. A consistent quality connection so I can understand the agent I am connected with (you cannot otherwise I would not have had this issue to begin with)\n",

In my opinion if you change tires for a living you should be able to figure out how to do it on your own. He did not try to figure it out by himself but instead I had to essentially do his job by showing him how to get the spare down. And then I assisted in changing the tire because he didn’t know how to. This was really frustrating because I know how to change my tire but was using a service that I pay for to come out and do it for me.

Why the enormous change from last year's renewal of only $202 ??? It seems that the first adviser, decided without asking me, to push me to a higher level. Bait and switch is a really low level deceptive sales method and unworthy of a fine company like OnStar. The second adviser was understanding and very helpful. I will be given a credit on my Mastercard for the $426.39 and was now charged $204.66. What an improvement. The second adviser gave me excellent customer service and restored my trust in OnStar. I would suggest that a supervisor give some training to the first adviser and discuss building customer loyalty through integrity. OnStar has a wonderful, well earned reputation.
